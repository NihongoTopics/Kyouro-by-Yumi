dialect.” Controversial claims about this dialect not supported by explicit
references are based on my introspections.

does not include sound.
・ Alphabetically ordered English words are given in place of page numbers.
Sometimes the symbol “»” is employed to mean “refer to” with the English word
assigned to the designated page. (“»apple” reads “refer to the page apple.’)
・ Examples written in the Hepburn notation do not always reflect word boundaries
as analyzed in Kyouro, but an effort was made to make the notation mostly
consistent with Kyouro.
・ The variant of the Japanese language described in Kyouro is intended to be the
one that is conventionally called Tokyo Japanese in the literature or a version of it.

THE LACK OF INSTRUCTION ON TONES AND INTONATIONS
One example is the lack of instruction on typing. Today, written languages are
primarily composed on digital devices such as computers and smartphones.   It has long been known that Japanese education falls short of giving students
