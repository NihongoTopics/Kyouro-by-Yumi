CHAPTER ONE: THE FRAMEWORK                                        (We use the symbol .”. for “therefore” and = for equivalence. The symbols + and -
stand for “plus” and “minus” here.)
TRANSCRIPTION OF MEANING                                                  The value represented by the tentative symbol X is something that becomes “only
Mugi” when “not” is added to it. This can be understood as a function that takes

not: only Mugi
An easy way to transcribe the meaning of a sentence is to translate it into another
language.                                                                                                                                                    Convention 1.1:
mugi mo kawaii. — Mugi, too, is cute.                                                                          i) The form A: B is understood as a function that takes A and returns B.
We translate sentence fragments to show partial correspondences between We then obtain:

Sometimes it is difficult to establish partial bilingual correspondences. Observe the           awame 1s cure
following example:                                                                                                                 nai — not
mugi shika kawaiku nai. — Only Mugi is cute.
TREE NOTATION
Intuitively, this sentence can be broken down into two major parts:
hik                                                                                                          Following Proposing, sentence structures are represented as trees. For semantics we

How can we construct the meaning “only Mugi is cute” by combining two forms, __ italicized when included in the tree notation.)
one of which is “is not cute”? We can do a pseudo-math with the following equation              ;                          7

And in the footnotes of the same page, he argues that Kuroda (1965) was the first to point out                                                                 sleep (ie)

Here it needs to be pointed out that, contrary to Kuno’s assertion, the distinction may have
been described in 1914, long before Kuroda (1965), by William Imbrie. To see this, a quick
comparison between the descriptions by Kuno and Kuroda, before comparing them with the
description by Imbrie, would be worthwhile. In Kuroda (1965), exhaustive listing corresponds
to characterizational judgment as opposed to nonpredicational description, which corresponds
to neutral description. Kuroda explains the nonpredicational description as follows:

What seems to be the same distinction was pointed out by Imbrie (1914). Imbrie classified ga
into four classes. Class I is the use of ga with a wh-word, such as doko or dare. An example of
Class I ga is “Dare ga iin ni narimashita ka” (p. 4). Class II seems to be the exhaustive ga in
Kuno’s terms. An example of Class II ga is “Kore ga byoin da” (p. 6). Class III is the use of ga
with “incisive precision.” An example of Class III ga is “Sore ga honto de gozaimasu” (p. 8).
