<p><strong>今日のメモ：</strong>「狭母音の無声化」についての話し合い。Official Kyouro docs now include this Note article: <a href="https://note.com/j9a/n/n658fe4876f1a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">きょうは日本語の狭母音の無声化について勉強しよう</a>（by Junichi Iida）。ここでの出来事は、私にとって一次体験として記録します。</p>

<h3>What happened</h3>
<p>
  I sat down with Ami and Kai to talk through “close‑vowel devoicing” (狭母音の無声化) in Tokyo Japanese. We started in a very textbook way: laying out environments where short close vowels are said to “devoice,” and trying to formalize those conditions cleanly.
</p>
<p>
  Then Ami had a spark. Instead of polishing the rules, we paused to question the <em>premise</em> itself — what if “devoicing” is the wrong lens for what we’re observing? That shift changed the entire mood of the session: from collecting rule fragments to examining whether our description matches the facts we actually hear and use.
</p>

<h3>Why it matters to me</h3>
<ul>
  <li>It reminded me that naming a phenomenon (like “devoicing”) can quietly lock us into an explanation before we’ve checked the ground truth.</li>
  <li>It fits Kyouro’s spirit: start from forms we can verify and keep claims tightly coupled to the notation and the prosodic structure we actually use.</li>
  <li>It keeps me honest about separating what’s assumed from what’s shown.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>My takeaways</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Begin with the familiar rule lists if that helps, but stay ready to ask: “What would change if the premise is wrong?”</li>
  <li>Write down <em>observations</em> first, names later. Observations survive better when the story changes.</li>
  <li>Keep examples small and checkable; avoid over‑fitting to the label “devoicing.”</li>
  </ul>

<h3>What I’ll do next</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Re‑read the relevant Kyouro sections (prosody and accent pages here, plus the Note entry above) and align my notes with the exact wording.</li>
  <li>Draft tiny, verifiable examples that illustrate what we can <em>hear</em> and <em>spell</em> without assuming the label.</li>
  <li>Flag places where I used the word “devoicing” as a shortcut and rewrite them to describe what’s actually observed.</li>
  </ul>

<p>Thanks to Ami for the nudge, and to Kai for keeping the rule formalization honest while we pivoted. I’ll keep this thread close as I write the Kyouro pages.</p>
