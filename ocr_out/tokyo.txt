SENTENCE INITIALISM

Japanese sentences used in this manuscript are referred to by a sequence of initials
of spaced words it contains, bounded by ##. For example, the sentence mugi shika
kawaiku nat is referred to as #+MSKN#, and mugi mo kawaii is referred to as #MMK#
If the sentence has a question mark at the end, the question mark is included in the

initialism. For example, the sentence doko itta? is referred to by #DI?#.

Sometimes, an orthographic sentence has different versions depending on the
positions of $. In the body text, these versions are distinguished with initialisms

that include $, such as #$DI?#.

Example sentences and their associated initialisms are given at the end of this
manuscript sorted in the alphabetical order. (Initialisms with $ are not included.)

Sentences with the same initial letters are listed under the same initialism.

CHAPTER ONE: THE FRAMEWORK

TRANSCRIPTION OF MEANING

INFORMAL TRANSCRIPTION OF MEANING
An easy way to transcribe the meaning of a sentence is to translate it into another
language.

mugi mo kawaii. — Mugi, too, is cute.

We translate sentence fragments to show partial correspondences between

Japanese and English:
mugi — Mugi
mo — too

kawaii — is cute

FUNCTION NOTATION

Sometimes it is difficult to establish partial bilingual correspondences. Observe the

following example:
mugi shika kawaiku nai. — Only Mugi is cute.

Intuitively, this sentence can be broken down into two major parts:
mugi shika — ?
kawaiku nai — is not cute

How can we construct the meaning “only Mugi is cute” by combining two forms,
one of which is “is not cute”? We can do a pseudo-math with the following equation

and solve it for X.
X + is not cute = only Mugi is cute

“. X = only Mugi — not

#MMK# #MSKN#

Page 4 of 53

(We use the symbol .’. for “therefore” and = for equivalence. The symbols + and -

stand for “plus” and “minus” here.)

The value represented by the tentative symbol X is something that becomes “only
Mugi” when “not” is added to it. This can be understood as a function that takes

“not” and returns “only Mugi,” which we write:

not: only Mugi

Convention 1.1:

i) The form A: B is understood as a function that takes A and returns B.

We then obtain:
mugi shika — not: only Mugi
kawaiku nai — is not cute

which can be further broken down into:
mugi — Mugi
shika — not: only
kawaiku — is cute

nai — not

TREE NOTATION

Following Proposing, sentence structures are represented as trees. For semantics we
put the terminal nodes at the top. A parent node is placed below its daughters. The
last two sentences are represented by the following trees. (The phonetic form is

italicized when included in the tree notation.)

CONTEXT AND REFERENCES

CONTEXT

Consider #MSKN# again. A reasonable introspection would reveal that the meaning
of the translated version of the sentence can be broken down into roughly the

following:

Mugi is cute.
Everybody else is not cute.

A
(   B _ means A, B, ... and Z.)

Z

Who is everybody else? This depends on the context. Let us say Mugi is a cat and
there are two other cats, Bibi and Runa, living in the same house, and suppose that
the statement is about these three cats. Now the statement can be decomposed into

the following:

Mugi is cute.

Bibi is not cute.
Runa is not cute.

In this case, the triple |Mugi, Bibi, Runa] is the context of Mugi. Each element of a
context is called a topic. The sentence however does not specifically say that the
other members of the context are Bibi and Runa. When a part of a sentence refers to
an entity, the reference carries a context, but the rest of the contents of the context

remain implicit as to what they refer to.

In the literature, concepts similar to our context are often rather informally employed. Kuroda
(1965) uses the term relativized universe to talk about the scope of the exhaustive ga (see

#MSKN#

notes in pp. attention-boy) and Kuno (1973) discusses “registry of discourse” (see notes in p.
bunnies). In formal semantics the term “domain” is often used to mean the set of denotations
under consideration. Perhaps the defining feature of our concept of context is that it is
independently postulated for each input of an article (see p. attention).

Definition of context:

For any referent X in a sentence, the context of X is the triple [x xX’, X | where
X' and X"’ are implicit, X #4 X’, X # X"’, andダデパ
(チ stands for non-equivalence.)
The dichotomy between the topics with and without primes is analogous to Numata’s (2009,
pp. 37-58) dichotomy between jisha and tasha although, unlike our topics, Numata’s terms

refer to syntactic objects. Jisha and tasha do not distinguish between exhaustive and non-
exhaustive references (see also p. ditto).

With the prime symbol, we can rewrite the meaning of the sentence as the

following:

f Mugi is cute

く Mugi’ is not cute

Mugi”’ is not cute
い

This is a more accurate representation of the meaning of the sentence. When we
interpret a sentence, we typically process it as a component of a discourse. Some
may say for this reason the meaning depends on the discourse. But surely a
sentence has some intrinsic meaning. While the actual effect of the same sentence
can be differently inferred from different surroundings, it would not be reasonable
to claim that given the discourse, the internal elements of the sentence do not
matter to the meaning. Therefore we need some way to isolate semantics from
pragmatics. The idea is analogous to phonology. In phonology, we think that a
physical sound is a superficial realization of a truer, more abstract representation of
a phonological segment. Here, as the worldly referents of the context of Mugi may
vary utterance-to-utterance, we devised a means to represent contexts the way

semantics should handle them.

ARTICLES

Articles of the reference dialect include ga, mo, wa, o, and dakeo, among others. They
are some of what are commonly referred to as “particles,” but not all particles are an
article in our terms. An article generally requires some reference to the context.
Each relevant topic of the context needs to be specified for the polarity of the
predicate. This implies that the polarity of a sentence is more complex than it may

appear.

It is widely accepted that at least two different interpretations can be associated
with ga. One of them is called the exhaustive reading, and the other is the neutral
reading, with slight variations of each term. According to Kuno (1973, p.38), this
distinction was pointed out for the first time by Kuroda (1965) (this claim is

dubious; see notes below). I will discuss the exhaustive reading first.

Kuno’s (1973) explanations on the distinction between two types of ga’s are as follows:

“

C.         ga for neutral descriptions of actions or temporary states
Example:

Ame ga hutte imasu.
rain falling is
Tt is raining.’
d.         ga for exhaustive listing.2 “X (and onlyX) ...” ‘It is X that...”
Example:
John ga gakusei desu
student is
(Of all the people under discussion) John (and only John) is a student.’ It is
John who is a student.” (Kuno 1973, p. 38)
And in the footnotes of the same page, he argues that Kuroda (1965) was the first to point out
the distinction:

“The distinction between the ga for neutral descriptions of actions or temporary states and

the ga for exhaustive listing was first pointed out by Sige-Yuki Kuroda (1965a).” (Kuno 1973, p.

38)
Here it needs to be pointed out that, contrary to Kuno’s assertion, the distinction may have
been described in 1914, long before Kuroda (1965), by William Imbrie. To see this, a quick
comparison between the descriptions by Kuno and Kuroda, before comparing them with the
description by Imbrie, would be worthwhile. In Kuroda (1965), exhaustive listing corresponds
to characterizational judgment as opposed to nonpredicational description, which corresponds
to neutral description. Kuroda explains the nonpredicational description as follows:

“The claim made here is that a sentence does not necessarily represent predication in
the above sense but may be merely a description of a fact or situation. In such a sentence,
which we shall call nonpredicational description or simply a description,? the subject can be

considered neither the premise of some judgment nor something about which a predication is
made. Rather, the subject of the sentence is nothing more than an item which stands in a
particular relation to the verb of the sentence, just as the object, if the sentence has one is an
item which stands in a particular relation to the verb. |...|” (Kuroda 1965, p. 37. Underlines
are his.)

An example of a nonpredicational description is “hito-ga macikado-ni tat-te i-ru” (Kuroda
1965, p. 46).
Kuroda’s description of the exhaustive ga follows below.

“Now if, on the one hand, use of the ga-phrase is restricted to nonpredicational
descriptions and, on the other hand, use of the copulative expression byooki-da is restricted
to predications, then it should follow that the ga-phrases can never be the subject of the
predicate byooki-da. But this is not true, as seen below:

(57)  ano-hito-ga byooki-da.
that man             sick
That man is sick

(58) John-ga byooki-da.
John is sick

The English translations of (57) and (58) do not really help to clarify the meaning of these two
sentences. The two English sentences are more naturally taken to be translation of:

(59)  ano-hito-wa byooki-da.
That man is sick.

(60)  John-wa byooki-da.
John is sick.

which represent the familiar type of predication. But sentences (57) and (58) are not
descriptions either; seeing John lying on a bed, one would say:

(61) a, John-ga byooki-de ne-te i-ru.
sleep (lie)
Oh, John is lying sick (on the bed).
but not:
(62) a,John-ga byooki-da.
Oh, John is sick.

attention
The difference between the kind of judgment represented by (57) and (58) and that
represented by (59) and (60) lies in the fact that (57) and (58) mean not only that that man is
sick and John is sick in the usual reading of these English sentences, but also, conversely, the
sick one is that man and the sick one is John. Sentences (57) and (58) characterize that man

and John by the property of sickness, rather than just attributing that property to them. This
characterization is, of course, made within some relativized universe. In the actual discourse

the universe is explicitly or implicitly delimited, so that the characterization takes place
within those limits (which may be vacuous, i.e., the relativized universe may coincide with the
whole universe). Let us give an example. Assume that a doctor is called, and when he comes
he finds three people, John, Bill, and Tom lying in bed. He then wants to know which one of
them is sick. When his question is answered, the relativized universe includes only the three
people in bed. If the answer is (58), then John, but neither Bill nor Tom, is sick. If on the
contrary, John and Bill are sick, but not Tom, the answer should be:

(63)  John-to Bill-ga byooki-da.
John and Bull are sick.

On the other hand, if the doctor is given (60) as an answer, then he knows that John is sick,
but he gets no information about the other two.

The following two sentences can replace (58) and (63), respectively:
(64)  byooki-na-no-wa John da.

The one who is sick is John.
(65)  byooki-na-no-wa John-to Bill-da

Those who are sick are John and Bill.

These forms can be considered as derived from (58) and (63) by a transformation, but we will
not discuss that transformation here.

As an another example one may say:

(66) — ningen-ga hane-no-na-i nihon-asi-no doobucu-da.
man                 feather-not        two-leg animal
Aman is a featherless biped.

characterizing human beings by that property. In this case one may say that the relativized
universe of the characterization coincides with the whole universe, and in this sense (66) may
be taken as a generic statement.” (Kuroda 1965, pp. 48-50. Underlines are his.)

In Kuno (1973) and Kuroda (1965), using Kuno’s terminoogy, neutral description is pure
description of what can be said about the subject in an event or stiation, and exhaustive
listing “singles out” the one that satisfies the predicate from the “registry” (Kuno’s term) or
“relativized universe” (Kuroda’s term).

What seems to be the same distinction was pointed out by Imbrie (1914). Imbrie classified ga
into four classes. Class I is the use of ga with a wh-word, such as doko or dare. An example of
Class I ga is “Dare ga iin ni narimashita ka” (p. 4). Class II seems to be the exhaustive ga in
Kuno’s terms. An example of Class II ga is “Kore ga byoin da’ (p. 6). Class III is the use of ga
with “incisive precision.” An example of Class III ga is “Sore ga honto de gozaimasu” (p. 8).

Class IV seems to be the descriptive ga in Kuno’s terms. An example of Class IV ga is “Sakuban
kaji ga arimashita’” (p. 11).
By way of precaution, the following are excerpts from Imbrie’s descriptions of the four classes
of ga.

“CLASS I.

Subject and predicate are connected by Ga, when the subject is one of the
interrogative pronouns. These are Dare, donata, dochira, dore (with its adjective form dono)
and nani: Who? which? what? Doko, Where? (what part of?) when the subject, is also followed
by Ga.” (Imbrie 1914, p. 4)

“CLASS II.

Subject and predicate are connected by Ga, when the purpose of the sentence is to

indicate, or (in questions) to determine, which one of a number is the subject by which in fact

the predicate is qualified.” (Imbrie 1914, p. 6. Underline is mine.)
“CLASS III.
Subject and predicate are connected by Ga, when the purpose of the sentence is to
indicate, or (in questions) to determine, the subject with incisive precision.” (Imbrie 1914, p. 8)
“CLASS IV.

Subject and predicate are connected by Ga, when attention is directed to the subject,
though without the selective emphasis of Class II, or the incisive precision of Class III

Generally however, though not always, in such sentences in English there is at least an
appreciable emphasis on the subject.” (Imbrie 1914, pp. 10-11. Underline is mine.)

The explanations and examples suggest that Kuno (1973), Kuroda (1965), and Imbrie (1914) all
highlight the same distinction. It appears, therefore, that Imbrie’s description was overlooked.
(To confirm my interpretation of the situation, I consulted Kondo (p.c.). After kindly
reviewing Imbrie’s monograph, he agreed that the two linguists seem to have overlooked this
description, which preceded theirs by decades. He further noted that, to his knowledge,
Imbrie’s classification of ga has never been introduced in the literature.)

It is also notable that Imbrie (1914) classified wa into four classes. It seems that the distinction
between Class II and Class IV well corresponds to the distinction between the contrastive and
thematic wa’s.

Kuno (1973) puts forth the following sentence as an example of the exhaustive ga.
In his words, this sentence means “(Of all the people we are talking about) John
(and only John) is a student; it is John who is a student” (p. 51), which seems to fit

well with what I can observe in my introspection.

boy
jon ga gakusei desu. — It is John who is a student.

(The Japanese sentence and the English translation are both from Kuno 1973, pp.

38, 51, 60. Romanization of Japanese has been altered.)

Kuno’s explanation of the exhaustive ga is sufficiently precise for our purpose. To
cite his words again, “all the people we are talking about” should correspond to
what we call the context. (See notes below as what it takes to be “the people we are
talking about” may need some attention). Within the context, John is a student, and
everybody else is not a student. In our notation, Kuno’s account can be represented

as the following:

John is a student
John’ is not a student
John”’ is not a student

He seems to have failed in his wording to be precise about the distinction between pragmatics
and semantics. He claims that, taken literally, whether a given object or concept can be used
as a theme of a sentence depends on whether the object or concept has been mentioned in
the discourse:

7 seems that only objects and concepts that have been mentioned and recorded in the
registry of the present discourse can become themes of sentences. |...| Objects of some specific
references are added to the registry of the current discourse the first time they are
mentioned|.| [...] Only after this entry in the registry is accomplished can they become
themes of sentences.” (Kuno 1973, p. 39)
It is difficult for me to believe that he truly intended to claim what this assertion seems to
contend. The grammaticality of a (non)sentence is independent of the discourse. A speaker of
a language can utter a sentence that deviates from the discourse. Take the following discourse
as an example:

John said he liked Sarah.

The cat walks, but the books need a shower and medication.

Compare:
John said he liked Sarah.
*Liked John she too Sarah said.

The first discourse is made of acceptable sentences only, but it is odd because the second
sentence does not seem to fit into the conversation. This utterance is wellformed and deviant.
The second discourse, in contrast, has an illformed utterance (a nonsentence), but a
charitable mind would promptly comprehend that the second speaker wants to say “Sarah

#JGGD# #JSGJA#

said she liked John too,’ which perfectly fits in the conversation. This utterance is illformed
and cooperative. Illformedness and deviance are different.

Perhaps he meant some hypothetical discourse the sentence assumes which under the ideal
condition the actual discourse mirrors completely. (The discussion in the body text is based
on this assumption.) Maybe this kind of idealization should be understood without saying,
just like other types of idealization conventionally done in linguistics. But here it seems
crucial to draw the line between inferences made from the actual, objectively observable
elements in a discourse and elements that a sentence or parts of a sentence refer to. When we
talk about the intrinsic meaning of a sentence, we should only talk about the latter.

Some may have noticed that the semantic representation of #JGGD# above is

analogous to that of #+MSKN#, reproduced below:

f Mugi is cute

+ Mugi’ is not cute

Mugi”’ is not cute
、

(Reproduced)

I do not claim that jon shika gakusei ja arimasen is completely synonymous with
#J]GGD#. The difference between ga and shika ... nai comes from somewhere else
than what the prime notation can cover. Part of the difference will be treated in
Chapter Two. As far as the prime notation is concerned, the two constructions are

equal. The prime notation is not the whole picture.

The meaning of shika and ga can be schematized as follows:

Observation of shika and the exhaustive ga:

X’not Y
The meaning of a sentence X shika Y nai is schematized as: く "not Y.

メア
The meaning of a sentence X ga Y, where ga is the exhaustive ga, is schematized

XY
as: < X’notyY.
ダメ“not Y

(Seeing them as sets, they are identical but tor now we pretend that the order of

elements matters without stating how.)

bunnies
We can obtain the meaning of the neutral ga by simply removing the lines of the
primed topics from the meaning of the exhaustive ga. As Kuno observes, the
neutral ga is more restricted in distribution than the exhaustive ga. It can only
appear with a predicate that represents, in his words, “an action, existence, or

temporary state” (p. 60).
jon ga gakusei desu. — It is John who is a student. (Exhaustive)
(Reproduced)
jon ga kita. — John came. (Neutral) / It was John who came. (Exhaustive)
(From Kuno 1973, pp. 53, 60. Romanization is altered.)

The latter can be transcribed as:

John came          (Neutral)

John comes
John’ does not come (Exhaustive)
John’’ does not come

Observation of the descriptive ga:

The meaning of a sentence X ga Y, where ga is the neutral ga, is schematized as:
xX 7

Similarly, a sentence with mo can be schematized as follows (recall #MMK#):

Observation of mo:

メア
"アダ

The meaning of a sentence X mo Y is schematized as: 1

Lastly, let us take wa as an example of an article. The mainstream treatment of this
article is to divide it broadly into two kinds: the contrastive wa and the thematic wa.
In our framework, this particular distinction is considered inessential. The prime
notation treats them identically. Later chapters sporadically discuss how the

conventional categories are described in our theory of semantics. Readers who are

#JGGD# #JGK# #MWK# #TWJGI#

distracted by the familiar distinction are asked to interpret wa as the contrastive

one unless otherwise noted.
Consider the following sentence:
(satoko wa pati ni kita kedo) masao wa konakatta.
(From Tsujimura 2007, p. 408. Parentheses are mine. Romanization is altered.)

The part masao wa konakatta is represented in the prime notation as:

Masao does not come
Masao’ comes

In this particular case, we can infer from the parenthesized part that the primed
topic refers to Satoko. But referents of primed topics are inherently implicit. This is

shown by the following example:

tokyoni wa jon ga iru.

(From Kubo 1994, p. 26. Romanization is altered.)
This sentence is interpreted as the following:

In Tokyo John is present
In Tokyo’ John is not present

In this case, we do not know what the primed topic in Tokyo’ refers to.

Observation of wa:

メア

The meaning of a sentence X Y is schematized as: 4 ©),
X’ not Y

Compare this with the case of ga. In both cases, like shika, the semantic
representation includes primed topics and each primed topic present is specified
for the polarity of the predicate. The article decides which topics are present and

which of them receives which polarity.

WHY THREE TOPICS?

Each context has exactly three topics. The prime symbol is only used for two of the
topics, one with just one prime, and the other with two primes. When all three
topics appear, we know that the context is exhausted. (Each primed topic does not
necessarily correspond nicely to a worldly entity. Surely when you refer to a person

in your sentence you can think of more than three people in the context.)

A practical implication of having more than two topics in a context is shown by
#MMKz#. Unlike #MSKN#, even within the context of mugi we do not know who else
is cute. If in the context of mugi of #MMK# the primed topics are Bibi and Runa, the
other cute one is either Bibi or Runa, but we do not know which. This is because
mugi mo is a non-exhaustive reference with respect to the context of mugi whereas

mugi shika is an exhaustive reference.
The meaning of #MMK#* can be written as the following:
1 Mugi is cute

Mugi’ is cute

Convention 1.2:

i) When we refer to only one of the primed topics, we use exactly one prime.

If the contents of a context are variable, why do we restrict a context to have exactly

three topics? Assume that we alternatively have a context with four topics. In this
case, a context would have three primed topics: |X, X XX my. An exhaustive

reference would make use of three primed topics, and a non-exhaustive reference
one or two. Here is the problem with this alternative system: in the reference
dialect, we do not (yet) find a minimal contrast between an expression that refers
to exactly two out of three primed topics and one that refers to exactly one. If such
a case is found, our three-topic system is then falsified.

Roughly speaking, for given X, X’ is “something else,’ and {X’, X’’} is “all else.” A four-topic

system would introduce another mode of quantification in between. Whether a four-topic
system is generally unfit for human language would be an interesting question.

NODE STRUCTURES AND OPERATIONS

THE VINCULUM NOTATION

f Mugi is cute

Recall that #MSKN# means 4 Mugi’ is not cute . Here, the topic Mugi receives is

Mugi”’ is not cute

a

cute while the primed topics receive is not cute. We are dealing with two different
comments for this sentence. The difference between is cute and is not cute lies in the
polarity. The former is positive and the latter negative. This is an example of a case
where for the same sentence topics of the same context receive comments of

opposite polarities.

The semantic form of the predicate of this type of sentence contains both versions
of the comments. At the same time, the sentence needs to know which topics
receive which comments. We need some means to “divide” the comments and the
topics into two groups: one that has the positive comment and the corresponding
topics, and the other that has the negative comment and the corresponding topics.

We use the following notation to implement such a mechanism (the vinculum

notation):
is not cute
kawaiku nai — 一
Is cute
Mugi’, Mugi“
mugi shika —     9 9
Mugi

Each side of the vinculum (the line in the middle, as shown above) of a node is
called a half (plural: halves). The one on the upper side of the vinculum is the upper
half. The one on the lower side the lower half. A half may contain more than one
topics, separated by commas. The usage of the comma will be explained later, but

here what matters is that the primed topics of mugi shika are in the upper half.

ditto
When the node of the topics and the node of the predicates merge, the upper half
matches with the other upper half, and the lower half matches with the other lower
half. In the case of #MSKN# when mugi shika merges with kawaiku nai, the topics

Mugi' and Mugi’'match with the comment is not cute, and the topic Mugi matches

with the comment is cute.

THE DOT NOTATION

When halves A and B match, we write A - B, in which the dot is called the operator
of the match and A and B the operands. The terms operator and operand are used
concerning a given match. When we refer to the symbol in other contexts, the dot is

called simply a dot.

A       C
When 3 and D merge, A and C and B and D match, where A, B, C, and D are the

operands of the matches. As a result, we get     . In the tree notation, this

operation is represented as:

/                                                                                                                   >

C
D

by | >

\.                                        ノン

An operand may be a bundle. A bundle is a list of topics (the order matters)

represented in the form A, B or A, B, C, where A, B, and C are topics.

In the following example, the list A, B matches with X.

4                                                                 Y

#MSKN# is an example of a sentence with this exact structure:

#MSKN#

f Mugi’, Mugi’’ isnot cute                                                                                                       )

MOOD

Semantic derivation begins from a linear sequence of the terminal nodes of a tree
corresponding to the sentence in question. This linear sequence is called the base
structure, or the base for short. The tree is formed in a step-by-step fashion, with
each step involving two nodes merging. The root node is obtained by merging a
node with a special node called mood. When a node merges with a mood, the node
is converted to a list of implications. This list is called the body of the clause and is
shown with brackets: []. An implication represents part of the surface meaning of
the sentence. Implications are represented in such a way that they are similar to

natural language, but the method of precise interpretation will be discussed later.

A mood is placed in the base as the rightmost node of the clause. For example,

#MSKN# is represented as the following:

一                                                                                                                                     >
Mugi’, Mugi’’ isnot cute
Mugi              is cute
Mugi’, Mugi’’- is not cute
Mugi - is cute
Mugi'・is not cute
Mugi’’- is not cute
Mugi・is cute
L                                                                                                                                      ノ

The mood of this sentence is represented by the symbol . (period). This mood is
called the indicative mood. It is used to indicate that the sentence is a declarative

sentence.

emission
In the simplest case, the body of a sentence is obtained by simply ignoring the

A:C
B-D

vinculum of the node merging with the mood.        is converted to      | This

process of converting and merging a node with a mood is called finalization:

Convention 1.2:

。 4・C
i) 一一   M
B-D

au
B-D
(M stands for a mood.)

is finalized as a list of implications

When merging with a mood, a node

i 5   (the vertical order matters). The product of this merge is represented as
A-C) y
B-D.
., A,B-X
ii)                   M
C-Y
A-X
B-X|M
C-Y

In finalization, an operand matched with a bundle is duplicated and distributed

to each of the elements of the bundle.

THE NULL TOPIC

Mugi is cute                   oo
#MMK# means          . This corresponds to the set of implications

Mugi’ is cute

Mugi - is cute      ーー
os      . According to Convention 1.3, the implications can be obtained
Mugi ・is cute

from:

Mugi, Mugi’- is cute.

We want to represent this as a form with a vinculum. As a placeholder, we define

the null topic, represented by the symbol 0 as defined in Convention 1.4:

Convention 1.4:

X-Y X-Y
0-Z O

i)

is equivalent to

x-Y

is finalized as [X - Y] M.

X:-Y

Therefore,     a is finalized as [X - Y] M.

Consequently, the meaning of #MMK# is given as follows:

eloquence
THE DUMMY

In some cases we want the structure       but do not want X to have a concrete

a
meaning. For such cases we use the symbol @ and obtain      . The symbol a is

called a dummy.

Dummies are necessary only for derivation. On finalization, we apply the following

convention:

Convention 1.5:

i) [a-X] っ区]

When an implication would otherwise have a, the a and the accompanying dot

are deleted.

NEGATION

Yasashii and yasashiku nai take the following forms:

.          is kind
yasashii — -
is not kind
      t kind
yasashiku nai — ーー
is kind

Shika is sensitive to negation (*“Mugi shika kawaii). There must be some way to
structurally distinguish the negative form such as yasashiku nai and the positive

form of the same “basic” item such as yasashii. To accomplish this, we introduce the

aX
forms a and ——. The former corresponds to the negative version of a predicate,

a

and the latter the positive version. We may refer to the former a negative predicate

and the latter a positive predicate.

Convention 1.6:

i) —X denotes the negative counterpart of X.

The nodes of yasashii and yasashiku nai are represented as follows:

is kind
yasashii — ————
sis kind

っis kind

yasashiku nai — —————
is kind

The new notation allows us to express shika’s sensitivity to negation:

Observation:

aX
A phrase headed by shika requires =

An interesting case regarding this requirement is illustrated by the following example:

erebetade shika ido ga muzukashii kata ga imasu. 一 There are those for whom only using
an elevator it is not difficult to move. (Naturally: “For some people, it is difficult to move
without an elevator.”)

(https://www.asahi.com/articles/DA3S15370750.html)

The form muzukashii used here is not a typical negative form. For this reason, some people
question the correctness of this sentence. It is likely that the sentence is ungrammatical for
some people and grammatical for the others. It is possible that the two groups of people have
different grammars, but a simpler solution is to attribute the difference to lexical entries.
Suppose that the form muzukashii corresponds to either one of the following semantic forms
depending on the speaker:

is difficult

ais difficult

ais not difficult

is not difficult

They mean roughly the same thing, but the former does not satisfy the requirement of shika

aX
while the latter does as it is in the form of >

Hence, it can be hypothesized that those who accept this sentence have the latter form as a
semantic form of muzukashii in their lexicon, perhaps with a semantic feature (see Proposing,
p. lungs) that indicates the item is “non-standard” (e.g., [+ colloquial]), and those who reject
it does not.

SERIALS AND PARALLELS

is kind             ais kind
To obtain the forms such as ————— and ———— from a more “basic” form like
ais kind            is kind
ーー                      .                   コル
is kind, we define two forms as possible nodes: X : —— and X: a
              え    コル     .
These are functions that take some input X and return —— and a respectively. If
is kind            ais kind
the input is is kind, the outputs are ————- and ————. This allows us to treat
ais kind            is kind

is kind as a node. The following sentences are examples of how the functions work

with the input.

yasashii. — is kind.

x
A node in the form ァ is a parallel. As a parallel has one operand on each side of a

vinculum, it needs to merge another parallel for the operands to match.

X:A

Once two parallels, for example, ァ and merge, the resulting node, ——,, is not a

parallel. A node in the form of        is treated as the same type as a node in the

form of X. These forms are called serial. A serial cannot merge with a parallel, but it

#Y# #YN# #MWMWN¥#

can be taken as an input by a function that returns a parallel. Such a function as a

node is called a parallelizer.

NEST

There are a few caveats as to when the input of a parallelizer is a complex node like

. Take the following example:

mugi wa miruku wa nonda. — Specifically Mugi drank specifically milk.

friction
This sentence has two arguments: mugi wa and miruku wa. The first innermost

lk                                  drink
ーー   , which can be taken by    ーー
milk’                                 adrink

argument is miruku wa or                                                     . When they merge,

milk « drink
milk’ - adrink
Mugi

Mugi

the result is           . This form is a serial. Because of this, the second

innermost argument         cannot directly merge with it. The predicate needs to

milk . drink
milk’. =drink

milk . drink
milk. =drink

be parallelized once again:                    . This form looks monstrous, but it

milk « drink
milk’ - adrink

xX
follows the same principle of X: x If the input is               , the output is

When the node               is finalized, the subform

milk « drink
milk’ - adrink

within the resulting

milk - drink
milk’ - adrink

 is converted to the form 1

implication. Such a structure is called a nest. A nest is a special type of segment,

which we will discuss later.

Now, introspect into #MWMWN# and find that this sentence means roughly the

following:

#OMSN#

| Mugi - milk - drink
Mugi - milk’ - sdrink

] Mugi-milk・-drink

| Mugi・ milk’ - sdrink

milk’ - adrink

no   milk - drink
milk’ - adrink

Mugi- mt - drink

Comparing it with the root node                                   っ we find that when

interpreting an implication with a nest the operand on the left side of the nest is

distributed to each of the lines inside of the nest. That is, the form X - 2 in a root

X:A

node is interpreted to mean 1       .
P                     X-B

Additionally, when negation is applied to a nest, the negator is “moved” to the top

line of the nest. That is, the form ~ 2 in a root node is interpreted to mean 1 "4

These two rules of interpretation will be restated in Chapter Two.

IDENTITY INDEX

A sentence with a relative clause can be decomposed into multiple sub-sentences.
Take the following example:
oishii miruku shika nomanakatta. — drank only milk that is tasty.

The meaning of this sentence can be broken down into:

 drank milk,
¢ didn’t drink anything else

milk, is tasty
.

That is, this sentence is a combination of the following two sub-sentences (clauses),

each of which can be adequately interpreted as shown:

fundamentals
た     .                                .     ee                                                                                                                                             ]
miruku                   oishii

milk,     xX: で istasty X:—— M
milk;                       is tasty
0                         ais tasty

milk, - is tasty
0
Imilki ・is tasty| M

miruku — shika            nom        anakatta
X’, xX”                      AX
milk,         XxX:                drink メー .
xX
milk’, milk’’                       っdrink
milk,                           drink

milk’, milk)’’- adrink
milk, - drink
milk,’ - adrink
milk,’’- adrink
milk, - drink

The symbol M stands for a mood.

Identity indexes are shown when the same meme appears in multiple terminal

nodes or when two memes that need distinction happen to have the same label.

A relative clause is said to be restrictive if the antecedent refers to one of the multiple entities
present that are referred to by the same noun. Compare the following:

(1) The house which is empty is available.
(2) The house, which is empty, is available.
(Both from Heim & Kratzer 1998, pp. 87-88)

(1) is intended to be a case of a restrictive relative clause and (2) non-restrictive. For (1) there
are potentially multiple houses and the one that is empty is available and for (2) there is only
one house and that house happens to be empty and available (Heim & Kratzer 1998, p. 88). In
effect, the distinction is simply between the case where the context includes two or more
houses and the case where the context includes only one house.

ROLE

Some lexical items can appear as part of an argument in one sentence and as part

of a predicate in another. Nouns are a class of such items. (In Proposing, nouns are

#SWKD#4 #KWSD#

defined as tokens that are either |m-i or |m-ii, but here the precise definition is
inessential.) A noun can appear as part of an argument when followed by an article
and as part of a predicate when followed by a copula. Take the following sentence

as an example:

saitosan wa kagakusha desu. — Specifically Saito is a scientist.

(-                                                                                                                                     >
saitosan wa              kagakusha_ desu
Saito         specifically scientist is
specifically Saito             is scientist

specifically Saito is scientist
\                                                                                                                                                                             ノ

Saitosan and kagakusha are nouns, and accordingly their positions can be switched

(although the meaning of the sentence will be different):

kagakusha wa saitosan desu. — Specifically the scientist is Saito.

kagakusha wa                  saitosan desu                                                                            )
scientist specifically Saito is
specifically scientist            is Saito
specifically scientist is Saito
、                                                                                                                                      ノ

Observations made in Proposing as well as the informal transcriptions of the
sentence examples above suggest that a copula like desu and a noun like kagakusha
and saitosan has node-hood in semantics. That is, a predicate like saitosan desu or
kagakusha desu is unlikely to be a terminal node. Therefore we want our grammar
to have some mechanism to make the predicate is Saito from the combination of
Saito and is, for example.
Consider the following translations of #SWKD# and #KWSD#:
A. Saito is a scientist.
B. The scientist is Saito.
They roughly mean:

A. Saito € scientist

B. scientist € { {Saito}, Saito}

garlic
where scientist is the set of all scientists in the discourse for each sentence.

From these transcriptions and the derivational trees given in the previous page, we can infer
that the meanings of Saito and is Saito are:

Saito — Saito
is Saito 一- で { {Saito}, Saito}
The semantic representations of the original sentences will be given shortly.

Some may feel that the said difference should be attributed to the general difference between
a comment and a topic instead. At the moment I am not able to dispute this. Yet, at least as a
notational convention, we proceed with the role /。 placed on a copulative predicate because 1

feel that clearly indicating the difference with a visible marker is convenient.

With the semantic representation of a copula, we can now decompose some items

that semantically contains a copula. Kawaii, for example, has been transcribed as a

This treatment adequately captures the inflection of adjectives. (Note, however,
that kawaii is not an adjective.) Recall that the adjective paradigm has, among many

others, the following suffixes:
i                 k-i\Aq/Ri
sa              k-i\R2/m-ii
(Proposing, pp. meiosis, moose)

The former makes a predicate form of an adjective, and the latter a noun form of it.

The following is an example of the former:
iskind

yasashii —
1 iskind

This form can be obtained through the following tree:

gaslighting
                          X                                                                                                                                               ヽ

The non-predicate, “bare” form of an adjective can be used as a noun. Take the

following example:

atsusa ga kibishii. — Exactly the heat is harsh.

と                                                                                             ~

hot ・i。 harsh

Switching the linear positions of hot and harsh automatically switches their

syntactic standings:

kibishisa ga atsui. — Exactly the harshness is hot.

(                                                                                                                                                                           ~
harsh X:

harsh ・i。 hot

Given that we have only dealt with very superficial aspects of the language—we have not

even considered semantic subcomponents of a noun, which probably include number,
specificity, definiteness, animacy, etc—it is reasonable to suspect that what we now regard as
the bare form of an adjective is not semantically equal to a noun. While further investigations

#AGK# #KGA# #YGKD# #KGSD#

into the reference dialect may reveal the necessity of additional markers for the “bare” forms
of adjectives, I am currently not aware of distinctions further than the binary distinction of
predicatehood.

The same treatment can be applied to adjectival nouns. Recall that the adjectival

noun paradigm has, among many others, the following suffixes:
[o]           km-i\C2
sa             km-ii\R2/m-ii
(Proposing, p. phenomenal)
The former, since it is |C2, can be used with desu to form a predicate:

yama ga kirei desu. — Exactly the mountains are beautiful.

(                                                                                                                                                                                                          ヽ

The latter can be used with ga to form an argument:

In jsX, jg is a role and X is a meme.

The term “meme” comes from The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins. In Chapter 6, Dawkins
discusses how replication and propagation of aspects of human culture can be understood in
the analogy of how genes are replicated and passed down to generations. He calls the notion
of a basic replicating unit of idea, habit, or any cultural component that a person can imitate
by the term meme. Examples of memes Dawkins puts forth include tunes and clothes
fashions. As it should be obvious from these examples, the notion applies to a broader
context than language. I chose the term because the internal contents of a (linguistic) meme,
in our terms, concerning real-world meaning, are invisible to language—it is treated as a
basic unit—and because it is replicated and propagated through language一-it is a currency of
semantics. The former point can be seen in our semantic representations of memes. The
symbols such as humble and liked are nothing more than arbitrary labels, and the grammar
knows only that they are distinct; it does not care what humble is like to us. The latter point
should be self-explanatory. We include memes in our semantic notation because we know for
a fact that, trivially, they are included in the meanings of sentences. (Dawkins points out that
the idea of God spreads through language.) Since the term “meme” can refer to non-linguistic
cultural units of imitation, we could pinpoint the notion of the meme as a component of
semantic representation by the term “linguistic meme” or perhaps “semantic meme,” but such
a meticulousness would be unnecessary because in the remaining parts of this manuscript we
do not mention non-linguistic or non-semantic memes.

Another example of a role is of This role, like /。, is copular Unlike ;., of is used to
express possession. Consider the following example:

NODE TYPES

The serial, the mood, and the root can be represented without a vinculum. An

example of a serial is Mugi.

The mood is denoted by the letter M. The root is denoted by the symbol RooT. The
other types are denoted using angle braces with a template of the form inside. The

serial is denoted in the form (X).

A parallel has a vinculum and a symbol on each side. An example of a parallel is

xX

4 jgcute                                    Y
A parallelizer has a symbol on the left side followed by a colon, which is then

followed by a vinculum with a symbol on each side. An example of a parallelizer is

THE TYPE OF A COMPLEX NODE

The type is determined based on the outermost structure of the node. In the
following, the angle brackets () are taken to be a function that takes a semantic

object and returns its type.

MEANING

TRUTH CONDITION

PROPOSAL, ENTAILMENT, AND PROPOSITION

The root node derives a proposal. A proposal is a structure of a list of entailments
and the mood passed from the root node. An entailment is a statement of whether
a specific proposition is true (+) or false (—) and is represented in the form +P,
where + stands for the truth value and P the proposition. A proposition is a

statement that is true or false for some event.

Convention 2.1:

SY

When converting a root node to a proposal, $ is ignored. (The symbol $ will be

explained in Chapter three.)

(where X and Y do not contain a negater.)

An implication with a negater is converted to a negative entailment. A

proposition cannot have a negater.

To be precise, the semantic form of this sentence should include the agent. Here and
elsewhere, some covert arguments may be omitted for simplicity. When arguments are
omitted from the tree structure, the corresponding parallelizers are also omitted. See Chapter
Four for why this is necessary.

Henceforth, we use labels for visual clarity. BASE, ROOT, and MEANING are given alongside the
base structure, the root node, and the surface meaning of the sentence, respectively. Later we
will use the labels SYNTAX and PHONOLOGY for syntactic and phonological structures,
respectively.

EVENT

An event is a set of segments. A proposition is true for an event iff all of its segments
are included in the event it refers to. Suppose that the speaker is aware of the

following two events:
event, = {festival, tomorrow, I, you, Yoshimi, go, ...}
event, = {doughnut, eat, I, yesterday, ...}

To be precise about the meaning of an event, segments need to have roles. From
{doughnut, eat, I, ...} alone, we cannot tell if 7 ate a doughnut or a doughnut ate me.

To determine the semantic relations, we can rewrite event, as:

event. = {gndoughnut, 」。eat byl atyesterday ...}

For the action (marked by /。) eat, the patient (marked by 。ヵ) is doughnut, the

agent (marked by by) is I, and the time (marked by g+) is yesterday. I often leave
roles implicit.

It was assumed until ver. 6.4 that exactly one event is assigned to a proposal. This
assumption has been found inadequate as no single event cannot satisfy a proposal

like the following, reproduced from p. nitrogen.

— Saito - takoyaki - eat

+ Saito - takoyaki’ - eat
+ Saito - takoyaki’’- eat
+ Saito’: takoyaki - eat
+ Saito’: takoyaki’ - eat

It seems necessary to allow multiple events to be alloted to the same proposal and

we accordingly adopt the following revised convention:

Convention 2.2:

i) Aproposal refers to one or multiple events. Each proposition of the proposal

is evaluated against one of the referent events.

ii) A proposition is true iff there exists an event assigned to the proposal such

that all segments in the proposition are in the event.

The aforementioned proposal is satisfied by a pair of events such as the following:

{ Saito, takoyaki’, takoyaki eat |
{ Saito ’, takoyaki, takoyaki’, eat |

This convention alone is insufficient to characterize sentences like #MSKN#, which
generates the following proposal, whose propositions must refer to the same event

to correctly capture the meaning.

ー Mugi’- cute
— Mugi’’- cute
+ Mugi - cute

Event assignment may be able to be better discussed with the notion of tense. We
assume the referent events are magically given for each proposal and discuss event

assignment no further at this time.

Given a reference X, the other references in the context of X are denoted as primed
topics (X’ and X’’). Suppose event E involves the state of being an engineer and the
themes John, Erica, and Chin-Wu. This event is represented as follows if John, Erica,

and Chin-Wu are not in the same context:
E = {jgengineer, ;,John, jrErica, itChin-Wui
it stands for theme, distinguished from patient.

If Erica and Chin-Wu are in the context of John, the event is represented as follows:
EF’ = fisengineer ;,John, ;,John’, ;,John’’}

Across the events assigned to the same proposal, a segment belonging to the

context of another segment must be shown as a primed topic.

henna
The intuition behind this formal convention of events is that an event is
distinguished from other events by what co-occurs in it. We expect that we can
“know” whether a given proposition is true for an event without such a formal
convention. We want the meaning of an event “meaningful” extra-linguistically.
(Introspection into the linguistic meaning is only possible if the linguistic meaning
is defined in such a way that it has some connection to extra-linguistic meaning.
This is analogous to how phonology must maintain some connection to phonetics
to meaningfully describe a language. As phonetics stands between phonology and

physics, events stand between semantics and worldly meanings. )

An event may have up to one comment to be referred to by a sentence. Suppose the

following proposition P and its event *E:

P = ;John- dorun
“E = {dolUn, do8 tolestival, byJohn, byErica}

to Stands for goal. *E is illformed.

If in the same event two actions (sleep and go) and two agents (John and Erica)
appear, nothing indicates which agent belongs to which action. Without a formal
convention, we would not be able to tell whether P is true or false. We simply do not
know what this event means. (Alternatively, we could have stated that all topics

belong to all comments simultaneously; the choice is arbitrary.)

Having multiple topics of the same role is not a problem. All topics belong to the

same comment. For the same proposition P, consider the following event F:

F = {qorun, byJohn, byErica}

For F, P is true because the segments の and 4 run are both included in F. For F,

the following proposition Q is simultaneously true:
Q= byErica ・dorUn

In event E, John ran, and Erica ran.

How do we knowif a given event has no more than one comment? For a segment of

an event, the role decides whether it is a comment or not. ,。 is a role with

comment-hood, as well as of

We do not worry about “impossible” events. If the comment of a given event is sleep,

it is unexpected that the event has a segment with the role +) because the action of

sleeping does not usually take a goal. Whether it is truly impossible to

conceptualize such an event is not an issue. The event {,,sleep, tafestival, byJohn}
has no problem with the proposition byJohn ‘ dosleep. The proposition is true for
this event because the segments by John and 4 sleep are included in the event. The

oddness of ¢,festival in this event does not interfere with this judgment. Ultimately,
the source of an event must be somewhere outside of language. For example, the
speaker’s consciousness seems to have some discretion over what event the
sentence refers to. (You can deliberately tell a truth or a lie.) The grammar may need
to filter out incompatible events, such as an event with non-primed topics
belonging to the same context, but it does not give directions on what should go
into an event; events are given to language as-is. The same can be said about an
event without a comment. Since all propositions have one comment, a
commentless event would falsify all propositions. This is not a problem of the

grammar because we then know the truth value (false).

A segment in an event cannot have a negater. (This is why we need the notion of

entailment on top of the notion of proposition.) The implication by John - > go sleep
is converted to the entailment — byJohn ‘do Sleep, whose proposition
by John - jo sleep is false for the events { by John, gorun} and { byErica, dosleep} and
true for { byJohn, do Sleep}. This convention ensures that the falsehood of a

proposition is simply the absence of any one of the segments it holds.

MOODS AND SENTENCE TYPES

PARTIAL INTERROGATIVE

Consider the following:
yoshimi wa isogashii? — Is specifically Yoshimi busy?

The speaker expects that somebody else is not busy, and based on this assumption

he asks if Yoshimi is busy or not.

(—                                                                                            >

Only the top entailment + Yoshimi - is busy is the target of the question. We call this

mood symbolized as ? the partial interrogative mood.

In the following sentence, it is assumed by the speaker that Yoshimi is busy, and the

question asks whether everybody else is not busy.

yoshimi shika isogashiku nai? — Is only Yoshimi busy? (Perhaps more naturally:

“Is Yoshimi the only one that is busy?”)

In both #YWT?7# and #YSIN?#, only the first entailment is the point of the question.
This is why the order of entailments matters. The first entailment of a proposal is

called the primary entailment and the rest the secondary entailments.
The case of mo is another good example:
yoshimi mo kuru? — Is Yoshimi coming too?

This question assumes somebody else is coming, and based on this assumption it
asks whether Yoshimi is coming. We need an entailment that roughly means
“Yoshimi is coming” as the primary entailment and one that roughly means
“somebody else is coming” as the secondary entailment. Our specification of mo

naturally achieves this result:

(                                                                   ヽ

TOTAL INTERROGATIVE

A total interrogative sentence has the total interrogative mood, symbolized as ;.
Consider the following:
taro ga waratta?

whose meaning is represented as the following structure of a root node.

| Taro - laughed
Taro’: slaughed | ;

Taro’’- slaughed

This amounts to asking if X in the following template, if it is to produce a

completely truthful proposal, is Taro.

be laughed
X’- alaughed
X"’- alaughed

#TGW?4 #MWT# #MMT#¥

Page 25 of 53

which could be translated roughly as “Is it Taro who laughed?” We call this type of
question the total interrogative because the scope of interrogation includes all

implications of the root node.

So-called wh-questions typically falls in the category of total interrogative.

Supposing a separate mood for the wh-questions as opposed to the typical yes-no questions
implies that these two types of questions have distinct predicate forms underlyingly. In the
reference dialect, the distinction is not necessarily reflected to the phonetic forms. Nani o
mimashitaka? (“What did you see?”) and nanika mimashitaka? (“Did you see anything?”) have
the phonetically identical (except for the difference in the typical $ positions) predicate form
mimashitaka (Kyouro: > mi・masltaka ). In English, the wh-questions and the yes-no questions
receive different intonations. How moods are mapped onto the phonological forms is
discussed in Chapter Four.

IMPERATIVE

The imperative mood is denoted by the symbol /. The following sentence assumes

that something else than peach is not eaten, and commands that peach be eaten.
momo wa tabete. — Eat at least peach.

The meaning of this sentence can be derived as follows:

DECLARATIVE
Recall:

#MST#

Observation of shika and the exhaustive ga:

X''not Y.
XY

The meaning of a sentence X shika Y nai is schematized as:

The meaning of a sentence X ga Y, where ga is the exhaustive ga, is schematized
メア

as: 4 X’notY.
"not Y

(Seeing them as sets, they are identical, but for now we pretend that the order of

elements matters without stating how.)

(Reproduced from p. bunnies)

Part of the difference between X shika Y nai and X ga Y is their orders of
implications. In the former, a negative statement is placed on top while in the latter

the positive statement is placed on top. As proposals, they can be written as:

—X'-Y
—X"-Y].
+X-Y
+X-Y
~x’.y]|.
_xX”".y

In a declarative sentence, the difference between the primary and the secondary
entailments may appear less clear. It may be worth thinking about what imperative

or interrogative sentence it should correspond to.

OTHER MOODS

Several other moods are likely necessary to cover predicative intonations and so-

called ending particles (discussed in Proposing, pp. clover-daydream).

CHAPTER THREE: INFORMATION STRUCTURE

PRELIMINARY

REVIEW

Definition of $:

In the phonological tree of a sentence, a phrase, except for fillers, has R at its
beginning iff it contains $, where $ is a feature that can be given to an AP; a
sentence has at least one AP with $; and the distribution of $ typically mirrors

the distribution of the information being asked for.

(Proposing, pp. scholarship-semantician)

QUESTION TYPES AND THE POSITION OF $

Consider the following example:

nani tabeta? — what did (you) eat?

ンー                                                                                                ~

Observe that #NT# is typically pronounced with $ at placed at the first AP only:
$nani tabeta?

This fits well with our previous observation. The distribution of $ typically mirrors
the distribution of the information being asked for. In a wh-question, the wh-word,

in this case, nani, works as a placeholder of the information being asked for.

#NT?# #DI?# #1K?# #DK?#

Observe the following examples of the distributions of $ and wh-memes. (Readers
who speak the language natively or fluently are asked to verify that they have $ at

the most “natural” or “typical” place.)

Compare the above with the following, where $ is placed not on the wh-words but

on the predicates:
nani $tabeta?
doko $itta?
itsu $kaeru?
dare $kaita?

These sentences probably sound unnatural. This is because $ is not placed on the

information being asked for (or its placeholder).
In a partial question, $ is typically placed on the AP of the predicate:

kore $taberu? — will (you) eat this? (Naturally: “Do you want to eat this?”)

a                                                                                                >

#K$T?# sounds natural because it is a partial question and $ is placed on the
predicate, where the polarity of the sentence is manifested. (Compare with #$KT?

#.)

In both total questions and partial questions semantic-$’s typically (but not
obligatorily) coincide with the information being asked for. This holds true for
declarative sentences too. Since the same literal declarative sentence can
correspond to multiple implicit questions, it is helpful to think about what question
the sentence corresponds to to determine its likely prosodic structure. The
following literal sentences are natural if pronounced with $ at the same place as the

corresponding question:
$kore tabeta. — (I) ate this. (Corresponding to #$NT?#)

kore $tabeta. — (I) ate this. (Corresponding to #K$T?#)

#NT?#4 #DI?# 41K?# #DK?# #KT?# #KT#

It is useful to see $ as a semantic feature because changing the position of it
changes the meaning of the sentence. When the difference in pronunciation
parallels the difference in meaning, it is easy to incorporate the phonetic or
phonological symbol into the system of semantic representation, just like how in
most practices of the study of semantics we use literal words to represent both
semantic and phonetic forms. Where necessary, $ as a phonological feature is called

phonological-$ and as a semantic feature it is called semantic-$.

$-THEORY IN SEMANTICS

TOPIC, COMMENT, AND SEMANTIC SEGMENT

We convert each implication into a collection of comments. This collection is called
a commentary. (We use the same terms “comment” and “topic” also in the context of
semantic derivation and subcomponents of implications. This is intentional.) The
comment is a basic unit of information structure. What this means will be

explained shortly.
An implication A - B - Cis converted to the following comments:

C
B-C
A:B-C

This process is called factorization of an implication.

Convention 2.1:

An implication A-B-C-...-X-Y-Z is factored to comments

“C-...:X-Y-Z

This conversion is done by building a right-branching tree from the implication.

The underlined nodes are the comments:

A B

QIN

万・
A-B:

>|

The components of an implication or a comment separated by dots are called
semantic segments or segments for short. Each segment points to some ét in the
world that the sentence assumes—be it a fact, an action, a person, a point in time, a
thing, or whatever—and an implication and a comment are a package of

cooccurring it’s.

$-SPECIFICATION OF COMMENTS
Take the following sentence as an example:

go

ashita omatsuri iku. > [tomorrow - festival - go| . => て festival - go

tomorrow - festival - go

The comment go refers to some action of going assumed in the sentence. The

comment festival: go refers to the notion of the action of going involving some

#AOI#

entity that is festival. The comment tomorrow - festival - go refers to the notion of

the action of going involving the entity festival and some entity that is tomorrow.

Unlike entailments, comments are not about claiming facts. A sentence of a negative
statement includes both the negative and positive versions of comments. (See #YWI# below.)
It is also possible that a positive comment is “highlighted” in such a sentence. An example is
shown on the next page as a commentary of #YWI#.
Go appears three times and festival appears twice. They are duplicates of the same
segments. We could put indexes to show their identities:

rc

80)

¢ festival, - go,

tomorrows - festival, - go,

、

Doing so, however is not necessary because the origin of each can be seen in the

implication and the derivative tree.

Some comments may be more important for the purpose of the sentence than the
other comments. The “important” part is what we have discussed earlier rather
informally as “the information being asked for.” A native speaker of the language
may variously describe the notion. Some may call it focus. Others may say it has

emphasis. Consider the following sentence.
yoshimi wa $isogashii. — Specifically Yoshimi is busy.

This sentence has the following implications and comments:

isbusy
Yoshimi -;. bus       Yoshimi -;. bus
#YWI# >         isomey | os        iso
Yoshimi’ - 7; busy          1; gbusy

Yoshimi’ - 4; ,busy

い

The last two comments (which correspond to the second implication) are
noticeably unimportant. (#YW$I# is not a case of the contrastive wa.) They would

easily go unnoticed in a normal conversation.

jargon
Now consider the following, identical in the common orthography but different to

the ears:
$yoshimi wa isogashii. — Specifically Yoshimi is busy.

This sentence produces the same four comments, but this time the most important
comment is the last one only. (This is a case of the contrastive wa.) Highlighted in
this sentence is that somebody else than Yoshimi is not busy. A natural response to

this sentence would be “who’s not busy?”

We speak of comments when we talk about information structure. Certain
comments stand out in the information conveyed by a sentence. Our purpose here
is to correctly characterize comments in such a way that phonologically contrastive
sentences are distinguished in the semantic representations as well. If two
sentences that yield the exact same set of comments (but with different
“importance” of some of the comments) phonologically differ only by the
placements of $, we want our grammar to correctly mark “importance” of the
comments differently for the two sentences. For the last two examples, we want the
following phonological and semantic representations. (We mark the “importance”

by placing the symbol $ at the top of the comment.)

| $ isbusy

$ Yoshimi :。 busy
yoshimi wa $isogashii. > ¢
1; gbusy

の  ef
L  Yoshimi’ - 4; ,busy

rc

isbusy

Yoshimi -;, busy
$yoshimi wa isogashii. > <
isDusy

 $ Yoshimi’ - =; busy

The former is an instance of what is in the orthodox categorization called the thematic wa. Of
course, this is at best an educated guess. We do not have means to directly communicate
meaning itself. Essentially, the only evidence we have for characterizing semantics of two
sentences differently is claims by linguists in such forms as “they mean different things” and
phonetic transcriptions. If two sentences receive distinct phonetic transcriptions and if the

#YWI#

author claims that they are contrastive (ie., they are distinguished in order to convey
different meanings), we take the description as evidence for associating different semantic
representations to the two sentences. (Ultimately, our semantic transcription system needs to
be able to capture all such claims.)

Where the symbol $ goes in the commentary depends on where $ is placed in the
phonological form. This assumption does not need additional justifications. We
have defined $ as a phonological feature first and the semantic difference that
justifies the contrast is now marked by $. The presence of $ on a spaced item in the
phonological form implies the presence of $ on at least one comment that includes
a segment corresponding to the item. In the examples above, the second sentence
has $ on yoshimi, which corresponds to the segments Yoshimi and Yoshimi’, and the

comment that has the latter is given $.

The literature has a rich set of technical terms for notions similar or related to
“importance” we deal with here. The terminology includes focus, given, and new,
among others, each with varying definitions and theoretical backgrounds. As far as
the phonological feature $ is concerned, binary specification of “importance” for
each comment suffices, at least for the sentences we will examine in version 6.0.
Given that binary $-specification suffices to predict phonological contrasts, any
distinctions more granular than that would be overcategorization. (If we ask if
binary $-specification of comments is truly enough, the question needs to be taken
back to phonology. While we can think of how information is presented in a
sentence from unrestrictedly many perspectives, distinctions are not justified
unless phonological contrasts are evident.) I avoid conventional terms where
possible. I will instead use the term $-specification (and $-specify, $-specified, etc) to
talk about whether a given comment has $. $-specification of a specific comment
may correspond better or worse to different conventional terms depending on the

comment, the sentence, and the discourse.

We began our investigation from phonology instead of logic because our purpose is to
characterize contrastive sentences from each other, but not to find logical expressions that
sentences seem to fit well with. (See also the other note in this page.)

BRINGING $ FROM AN IMPLICATION TO COMMENTS

All information in a comment, including $, comes from an implication. (In fact, we
do not add any information after the base. Semantic derivation, like syntax and
phonology, only handles what has been already given in the beginning. This means
that $ is present in the base. We will later discuss the procedure to deductively
assign $ to the implications from a given base.) We need a precise procedure to

assign $ to comments based on what is given as the corresponding implication.

As far as our observations so far concerned, the root node and the base of a clause generally
have equal or similar information. Therefore it may be generally possible to derive the base
from the root node. I do not have enough knowledge to rule out either one of them being the
truly initial state of sentence generation. At the moment, we assume that the root node is
derived from the base and not the other way around, but this is only for convenience.

Take #AOI# as an example. This orthographic sentence has the following versions:

#AO$I# > 4 $ festival - go

$ tomorrow - festival - go

#A$OI# > 4 $ festival - go

$ tomorrow - festival - go
.

gO
#$AOI# => < festival - go

$ tomorrow - festival - go
い

As shown, the presence of $ in a comment implies the presence in all outer

comments.

Convention 2.2:

i  たる
A-B

The presence of $ in a comment X implies the presence of $ on all comments

that includes X.

The purpose of this convention is to prevent overgeneration. We are trying to describe the
language's semantics as a formal system of discrete symbols; we do not want our system to
predict distinctions that the language never exhibits. It is not to claim that, say, there is a
$B

$A-B

correct. Rather, we restrict our notation in such a way that the former never appears so that

difference between vA p and 1       as commentaries and only the latter can be

the difference between them safely remains undefined.

The distribution of $ can be sufficiently described by simply inserting $ in the linear

structure of the implication.

#AO$I# > |tomorrow・festival・$go| . > 4 $ festival - go

#A$OI# > [tomorrow - $festival - go] . > 4 $ festival - go

Let us now turn to how $ jis assigned from implications to comments. We have
already seen how it is handled inside and outside of the scope of negation. The
convention is similar for nests. If $ is assigned outside of a nest, $ is not assigned to
comments sourced from inside of the nest. If $ is assigned inside of a nest, $ is not

inherited to comments sourced from outside of the nest.

In the base structure $ is placed in the same place as in the phonological structure.
The assumption that the base position of a semantic-$ is identical to the

However, the following pair of sentences reveal that given a sequence of APs the

ROOT

In both sentences phonological-$ is assigned only to the first AP but semantic-$ is
distributed differently across the sentences. The difference comes from the nodes
$X

SX “$x”

$X"
different articles assign $ differently, the distribution of $ is in part determined by

The former corresponds to ga and the latter wa. As

lexical properties.

#KGO# #NST#

Articles, when their corresponding AP receives phonological-$, assign semantic-$ to

lexically specified positions inside the resulting node.
Let us take another example:

$ninjin shika tabenai. — eats only carrot.

|                                      $ X'S メソ"                      aX                                                                                      )
BASE carrot X:——— eat X:— .
X
$ carrot’,$ carrot’’          seat
carrot                   eat
$ carrot’, $ carrot’’- seat
carrot - eat
$ carrot’ - seat
ROOT                  $ carrot’’ + seat
carrot - eat
\                                                                                                                                      ノ
$X',$X"

In this case, the node X:          , corresponding to shika, assigns $ to both

topics on the upper half of the resulting node.

The distribution of semantic-$ depends both on the lexical properties of certain
items and on the prosodic structure. It has been known in the literature that both
“particles” and prosody are relevant to the information structure of a sentence. $-
theory naturally explains how they work together to assemble the sentence

information.

Now, let us take one other example, dakeo, because this article is particularly

interesting. Consider the following sentence:

$koe dakeo kiita. — (I) heard only voice.

There seem to be two semantically similar or identical versions of the X dakeo construction.
One is where dakeo receives the R tone (Koe Dakeo kiita) and the other is where it does not
(Koe dakeo kiita). My guess at the moment is that the difference is at best paralinguistic. I
tentatively ignore the semantic difference between them, if any.

leeway
Because dakeo is pronounced as its own AP it may be better to assume that the origin of

$ carrot’, carrot’
semantic-$ is not the article but the meme on the left. Under this model,                           is
carrot

$X', xX”

obtained by merging ‘carrot and *X:          , where the superscript $ is aligned to the

position of phonological-$. (See the other note in this page for the spedification of dakeo.)
Regardless of the validity of this analysis, for simplicity, the superscript $ is omitted from the
notation unless otherwise noted.

Ignoring $-specification and the covert subject, introspection would reveal that this

sentence roughly means:

voice’ - shear
voice’’- shear
voice - hear

Note that the implications cannot be randomly reordered. Particularly, the

following order changes the meaning:

voice - hear
#1 voice’ - shear
voice’’- shear

This can be (probably) more easily seen when the mood is replaced with the partial

interrogative mood:

koe dakeo kiita? — Did (you) hear only voice?

voice’ - shear
voice” - shear | ?
voice - hear

The scope of the question is whether something else than the voice is heard, but not

whether the voice is heard.

The article dakeo needs to be characterized in such a way that it is ensured that the
implications are ordered correctly. Since in the intended order the top implication
is of the single-primed topic, dakeo as a parallelizer must put the single-primed

topic on the upper half. The problem is that the comment corresponding to the

#KDK# #KDK?# #KSK# #SSK# #SDK# #SSM# #4SDM#

single-primed topic has a negator even though in the phonological form the

predicate is in the positive form.

To solve this puzzle, the following derivative tree is postulated:

(                                                                                                                                      N
BASE voice    XxX:                      hear     メダ: ーー
AX                                           コア
コ ($ voice’, voice’)           hear
svoice                 shear

ココ ($ voice’, voice’’)  - hear       $ voice’, voice’’- shear

svoice - shear                  voice : hear

$ voice’ - shear

ROOT                          voice’’- shear
voice - hear
、                                                                                                         ノ
a($X',X"
Dakeo is assumed to be X:               . This contrasts with the shika ... nai construction,
=
$ XY.$ メソ                            $ voice’ - shear

with shika assumed to be X:

. The resulting root node, | voice’’- ahear| ., would

voice - hear
$ voice’ - shear
be | $voice’’- shear | .in the shika ... nai construction, i.e., “$koe shika kikanakatta.”
voice - hear

This reflects the following observations. First, typically, in X shika Y nakatta, the utterance

assumes that the hearer may expect that Y applies to everyone (i.e.,  [xX ,X', X''|), whereas in X

dakeo Y shita the utterance does not have such an assumption. Consider the following pair of
examples:

$sore shika kangaenakatta. — (I) thought only about that.

$sore dakeo kangaeta. 一 (1) thought only about taht.
In the former, the unerlying assumption is that 7 should have thought about everything (in the
context). In the latter, such an assumption is not expected. Rather, the utterance (relatively
easily) implies that J was supposed to focus on that. The underlying question here is whether I
thought about something else. This supports the present characterization of dakeo where only
one of the primed topics receives $.

Likewise, in the following pair of examples, the former rather than the latter implies 7 should
have brought everything (in the context) while the latter relative to the former more likely
suggests the wallet was the minimal requirement.

$saifu shika mottekonakatta. — (I) brought only my wallet.
$saifu dakeo mottekita. — (I) brought only my wallet.

lexington
ー (X’, $ Xx”

Why not X:                  ? Assume now that the context is [wallet, smartphone, computer]

ーー

and consider the following sentences:
e, $saifu dakeo mottekita no!? — Wait, is it that (you) brought only your wallet!?
e, $saifu mo mottekita no!? — Wait, is it that (you) brought your wallet too!?
e, $saifu o mottekita no!? — Wait, is it that (you) brought exactly your wallet!?
e, $saitu wa mottekita no!? — Wait, is it that (you) brought specifically your wallet!?

I find the last sentence is less natural than the others. I hypothesize that this relates to the fact
that wa is the only article that does not give $ to the top implication among mo, o, and wa. (It

$ X          $ xX, X’

and mo is X:

would be less controversial that o is X:                                    .) Since dakeo is

$ x’, $ xX”
っ(S$ X’, Xx’)
natural in the example above, I propose that dakeo is X:           rather than
3(X',$ Xx’)
aX

ーー

Earlier (until ver. 6.3), 1 noted dakeo as X:                        . The correction was made in version
6.4 reflecting the intuition explained above.

One peculiarity of dakeo is that it has a negator despite the fact that it is part of an

argument. In all other contexts so far, we have only seen negators on the predicate

side of a clause. The reason for this surprising setting is shown in the third line. The

a ($ voice’, $ voice’’)  - hear

node              is converted to equivalent

Avoice - shear

$ voice’, $ voice” - shear

;                  . In the conversion, the negator on the topics is shifted to
voice - hear

the comment (the usual position of the negator), and the two negators on the lower
half cancel out each other. (The parentheses are shown to make it clear that the
negator belongs to the entire bundle.) The resulting form then merges with the

mood. The resulting body correctly captures our previous observations.

Convention 2.8:

i) コX・アニメ・-Y
Anegator is shifted to the comment.

ii) ココタニ

#ESDMN?# #ESMMN?4 #ESOMN?# #ESWMN?# #4K# #TT#4 #SWTOT#

Negators cancel out each other.

PREDICATES AS $-ASSIGNERS

On the predicate side, if the corresponding AP has phonological-$, it has semantic-

$ on the upper half. Take the following sentence as an example:

$kawaii. — (It) is cute.

4                                                                                             >)

BASE it     X: — cute     xX:

Contrastive $-specifications are only possible if the sentence has two or more APs.

The following text corresponds to two possible sentences that differ only with $:
takoyaki tabeta. — (1) ate takoyaki.

If $ is placed only on the first AP:

/                             gx                        x                                                                                                     >

If $ is placed on the second AP:
(-                                                                                                                   ~
BASE takoyaki X: x    eat X: $x

ROOT           [takoyaki - $ eat] .
し                                                                                                                  ノ

Again $ is simply placed on the upper half of the predicate.

ISSUES ON COMPLEX PREDICATES

Consider the following:

4                                                                                            >

If $ was assigned to the second parallelizer of tabeta, the tree would generate the

f takoyaki - eat
Saito - $4 takoyaki' - seat

takoyaki"’ - seat
root node #          .                  っ which, to me, seems wrong for this

f takoyaki - eat
Saito’: +4 takoyaki' - seat

takoyaki’’ - seat

particular sentence.

#SWTOT#

Now consider the following:
saitosan wa takoyaki o tabenakatta.

This orthographic sentence is ambiguous between at least two interpretations.
Suppose in the context there are two people, Saito and Tanaka, and multiple dishes
one of which is takoyaki. In one interpretation, Tanaka ate exactly takoyaki and
nothing else, and Saito either ate something instead of takoyaki or ate nothing. A
natural response based on this interpretation is “If Saito did not eat takoyai, then
what did she eat?” In another interpretation, Saito ate everything but takoyaki, and
Tanaka either ate something not takoyaki or ate nothing. A natural response based
on this interpretation is “What, instead of takoyaki, did Tanaka not eat?” The first
interpretation is probably more accessible with $ placed only on tabenakatta, while

the second one is probably more accessible with $ placed only on takoyaki o.

These interpretations are represented as follows, respectively:

— Saito - takoyaki - eat
— Saito - takoyaki’ - eat
+ Saito’: takoyaki - eat
— Saito’ - takoyaki’ - eat
— Saito’ - takoyaki’’- eat

— Saito - takoyaki - eat

+ Saito - takoyaki’ - eat
+ Saito - takoyaki’’- eat
+ Saito’: takoyaki - eat
+ Saito’: takoyaki’ - eat

which are obtained through the following derivative trees:

CHAPTER FOUR: LEXICON

TYPE (CONT.)

ROLE

In the preceding chapters we assumed that roles are given by parallelizers. For the
sake of syntax, in this chapter we assume that roles appear as a node in the base

structure. The role is now admitted as a new type.

Convention 4.1:

i) (X) (er)

(ax) = (AEE) 2 0x)

A role takes an immediately preceding serial to form a serial with a role. Serials

with and without a role are considered different types. Only the former can be

taken by serial-to-parallel.

This allows us to redefine parallelizers with roles. The copula, previously defined as

rs区
メー (p. gaslighting), can be now redefined as:
MS
Xx:   ー
is の・ーマ

The following tree exemplifies that the two definitions achieve the same result:

(-                                                              ~

                                                              ノ

RELATIVE ROOT

Later in this chapter we will deal with the index mood, which merges with a node
and finalizes it. The node finalized by the index mood is a relative root, a special
type of root node that further merges with a serial. The index mood requires the
root node to have the index meme, a special meme for this purpose, as its leftmost
segment. When a relative root then merges with a serial, it is required that the index

meme and the serial are co-indexed.

Convention 4.2:

LEXICAL INSERTION

THE TARGET OF LEXICAL INSERTION

A lexical item is a basic unit of syntax. It is the interface between sound
(phonology, which then connects to phonetics) and meaning (semantics). Lexical

items are inserted to the base structure. Consider the following example:

yumi ga nakimashita. — Exactly Yumi cried.

(-                                                                                                              >
PHONOLOGY ‘yumi ga                nak’                 1-masita
Xx
BASE    Yumi py X: —— ec    X:—.
um by     X',X"    ty    do     AX
by Yumi                 doCry
by Yumi      docry
by Umt by Yumi”   _doCry
by mi ‘do Cly
by Yumi'.py Yumi" ・ “do cry
[py Yumi ‘do CLy   」
ROOT                           by Yumi: _doCry
by Yumi": _doCry
、                                -                     -                                                       ノ

On top of the base are the lexical items, written in Kyouro. In the tree notation, the
correspondence between phonological forms and semantic forms are indicated by
left-aligning the phonological form with the sequence of semantic forms it
corresponds to. Some correspondences are self-explanatory. The phonological form

‘yumi corresponds to the semantic form Yumi. That is,

‘yumi — Yumi

x
nak’ corresponds to the sequence of cry, 4, and X: xX

a

nak — cry         do

#YGN#

In many cases a single lexical item contains a sequence of multiple semantic forms.
In order to make the correspondence visually intuitive, the following notation is

employed:

nak

xX
X:—

cry      do                AX

This says that the phonological form nak corresponds to the semantic sequence of

x
CTY; do» and X : —— (in this order). This format will be used as the default notation

a

of a lexical item. The item ‘yumi is represented as the following:

‘yum
Yumi

When relevant, the syntactic labels are shown alongside the phonological form as

usual:

nak ./dv

xX
X:—

cry      do                AX

yumi R2/m-ii

Yumi

The lexical item ga is inserted to the sequence of by and X:———. This
correspondence can be represented as the following:
ga
x:   ー

ARITY

When the predicate receives an argument or adjunct, it must be in the form of a
parallel. When a predicate merges with a parallel, it must be made back parallel to
be ready for another, until the clause receives the mood. How many times it is

parallelized in the clause tells its arity: how many parallels it merges with.

xX
In #KYGN#, the predicate cy is parallelized twice by two instances of X: —.

a

Because this form appears twice after /。cの, we can tell, even without looking at the

nodes on the left, that there are two arguments or adjuncts for this predicate,
provided that the derivative tree is well-formed. Arity solves some cases of

structural ambiguity including the one that we saw in p. ignorance of Proposing.

I expect that this mechanism serves as a basis for case and valency, but in version 6.0 they are
not discussed.

An interesting case of variable arity is found as the structural ambiguity of a part
of the famous lyrics of Inaba (1993): boku wa kimi dakeo kizutsukenai. Taken as a
sentence, the text can be understood to mean (a) “you are not the only person
hurt by me” (shown below) or (b) “you are the only person not hurt by me”

(shown on the next page). The ambiguity comes from the variable arities of the

RELATIVE CLAUSE

To derive the meaning of a sentence having a relative clause, we simply drew a
separate tree for each relative clause. It worked for meaning, but deriving a
syntax tree poses a challenge. In syntax, a relative clause appears immediately
left to the antecedent. Consider again #OMSN#. The following is the syntax tree

along with the broad semantic notation of this sentence:

A4/R1
./A4
R2/m-ii
A4/Ri  R2/m-i A2\A4         A4/R1
oishii miruku shika nomanakatta
milk,         istasty milk, not: only didn't drink
milk, is tasty                not: only milk,
drank only milk,

uranium
In order to connect the two structures we postulate the following revised

structure.

The symbol 7 stands for a mood postulated for a relative clause. The symbol is
taken from the first letter of index. Merging the clause with a mood before

merging it with the antecedent ensures it can derive the proposal and the
commentary. When liemilk, ig tasty| i merges with the head noun, milk, the root

node of the relative clause is simply eliminated and then we obtain the same
milk, The mood i ensures that the head noun has the same index with the
leftmost segments of the node it merges with. It checks the indices and if they are

not identical, the base structure is illformed.

Index always sits in the leftmost position of a relative clause. The checking
process ensures that the relative clause obligatorily appears immediately left to

its head noun.

DAKEDE

Numata (2009, pp. 198-199) observes that the following sentence allows two
readings. In the first reading, the sentence means you can go there just by taking a
bus (no other means necessary) and in the second reading it means you can only go
there if you take a bus (no other means available). She calls the former the minimum
requirement (originally, “saiteijoken”) reading and the latter absolute requirement
(“zettaijoken”) reading.

I would like to note here that at least in my introspection, the first reading is not necessary

about what “minimum requirement” would usually refer to. In the first reading, the sentence

does not specify taking a bus as the necessary condition for reaching the destination. Rather,
it says that if you take a bus, you can reach the destination without using other means; it allows

the possibility that you can go there without taking a bus. Numata’s explanation, “/\ A (Cc 3€
ればそれだけで他の手段一例えば電車に乗ること一を使わなくてもそこへ行け
る” (p. 198) (“If you take a bus, that alone, without other means—such as taking a train—will

allow you to go there.” (my translation)) is compatible with my introspection, but her naming,
“saiteijoken” gives the impression that taking a bus is necessary. I assume it is only a confusing
name and it does not indicate that her introspection is different from mine.

only. That is, even if you take a bus, if you use an additional means, you cannot go

ENDNOTES (NOT REFERRED TO IN THE BODY TEXT)

The following is an unstructured list of notes that could have been incorporated in

the body text but have yet to.

i)

ii)

Kishimoto (2007, pp. 29-30) claims that the sentence b allows the interpretation
“speaking of birds, it is only that they fly” but not “only birds fly.” Based on this claim, he
argues that the thematic wa cannot appear inside the scope of dake.

a. tori ga tobu dake da.
b. tori wa tobu dake da.

This argument, however, seems to be a tautology. It is certainly possible to interpret b as it
birds
is only that 1      fy

something else does not fly’ Notice that the nested part patterns identically
with the case of the thematic wa unless the second line receives $. (Compare it with
#YWI# or #KWO#.) This interpretation is especially easy to access (perhaps obligatory)
when the sentence is pronounced as Tori wa tobu Dake da. But under this interpretation,
the wa is conventionally categorized as the contrastive wa. That is, any would-be
counterexamples may be dismissed here because “it is not the thematic wa.” To non-
trivially claim that the thematic wa cannot appear in certain position, it needs to be

shown that it is logically possible but is never actually realized.

The true scope of “we are talking about” for a particular sentence is generally inaccessible
for the listener (the problem of whether it is accessible for the consciousness of the
speaker is put aside), so studying a discourse does not reveal “the hidden meaning” of a
sentence. And entities referred to in a context which are not explicitly mentioned should
be semantically represented as implicit, even if the referent seems unequivocal in the
discourse. The meaning of a sentence differs depending on whether John is merely in the
context of something else, e.g., Sarah, or John is explicitly mentioned, including with a
pronoun. (The message—the pragmatic or real-word effect—of the utterance may be
identical.) Further, a context belongs to a part, not the whole, of a sentence; in “only John
only speaks English,’ meaning, John is the only person who speaks English and no other
languages, if reasonably interpreted, the context of John (whose worldly referents may
include John, Sarah, and Sumin) and the context of English (whose worldly referents may
include English, Japanese, and Esperanto) are distinct. It is for this reason why in our
framework it is semantic or lexical objects, as opposed to a sentence or a discourse, that

carry a context, such as | John, John’, John'"|.
