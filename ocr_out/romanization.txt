PROPOSING A NEW
ROMANIZATION
SYSTEM OF
JAPANESE
In a world full of polyglot Als, study Japanese to understand how language works.
PREFACE

ABOUT KYOURO AND THIS PDF FILE

Kyouro (rhymes with Kyoto) is a modern Japanese romanization system that unifies
the spelling, phonology, syntax, and semantics of Tokyo Japanese into a single
romanization method. It aims to let learners type, read, and understand Japanese

sentences directly from the romanized form without guessing hidden structures.

Kyouro includes two parts: the theory and the spelling system. The theory analyzes
how Japanese meanings, tones, and structures interact. The spelling system applies
that theory to create a practical romanization. Author: Junichi lida, aka

・ Feel free to redistribute this manuscript, partially or entirely, as long as the

original place is indicated.
・ This document is being updated at intervals. Errors are expected.

- Japanese sentences, phrases, and words are written in the Hepburn system and

Kyouro. When clarification is necessary, Hepburn is italicized and Kyouro is
boldfaced.

- Some sentences are taken from literary works such as novels and TV shows. Cited
sentences are written in either Kyouro or Hepburn even if the original notation is
in the standard orthography. The pronunciation is assumed where the source
does not include sound.

・ Alphabetically ordered English words are given in place of page numbers.

Sometimes the symbol “»” is employed to mean “refer to” with the English word

assigned to the designated page. (“»apple” reads “refer to the page apple.”)

- Examples written in the Hepburn notation do not always reflect word boundaries
as analyzed in Kyouro, but an effort was made to make the notation mostly

consistent with Kyouro.

- The variant of the Japanese language described in Kyouro is intended to be the

one that is conventionally called Tokyo Japanese in the literature or a version of it.

In some parts of this document, the intended lect is referred to as the “reference
dialect.” Controversial claims about this dialect not supported by explicit

references are based on my introspections.

THE PEDAGOGICAL PROBLEMS

LACK OF INSTRUCTION ON TYPING

Students learning Japanese in conventional settings, such as university foreign
language courses, face several problems in the course of learning. Some are
inherent difficulties of aquiring a foreign language, which are inevitable, but a few

are not so. In fact, Kyouro addresses certain problems precisely because they are
addressable.

One example is the lack of instruction on typing. Today, written languages are
primarily composed on digital devices such as computers and smartphones.
Japanese is not an exception. Hence, learning to write Japanese inevitably requires
learning how to use the Japanese input systems on these devices. But conventional
classrooms often neglect to give systematic instructions on how to type the phraes
they teach on the iPhone or Windows laptops. The focus is heavily skewed towards
handwriting; students spend a considerable amount of time practicing pen strokes
of hiragana, katakana, and kanji, leaving the more practial skills—precise

keystrokes and correct conversion—untouched.

Most Japanese speakers use kana input systems on smartphones and romaji input
systems on computers. Second language speakers, expecially those who speak
English natively, seem to prefer the romaji system, at least initially. Luckly, most
widespread systems offer a romaji input method on mobile and desktop, and the
students are somewhat familiar with romaji. At this point, some may assume that
they only need to know how to use their personal devices to type Japanese. The
truth is that the romaji input systems assume a slightly different romanization
system from the familiar romaji spellings seen in the textbooks and therefore the
students need to learn the specific romanization rules in order to properly use their

Japanese input softwares.

In short, JSL education needs to give the students explicit instructions on
romanization for typing. To address this issue, Kyouro serves as a reasonable
representation of how the language is typed in on digital devices. For example, the
moraic nasal is writtne as a single n in the Hepburn romanization system (the most
common one out side of digital contexts), potentially hindering the student from
correctly guessing the keystrokes of common phrases like konnichiwa, which is k-o-
n-n-n-i-t-i-h-a. In Kyouro, this phrase is written as konnitiha, mirrorring the
keystroke exactly, e.g., the number of n’s is how many times it has to be pressed
down to type it. Similarly, the small tsu in Kyouro is writtne either xtu or by

doubling the following consonant letter, which is just how it should be typed in.

THE LACK OF INSTRUCTION ON TONES AND INTONATIONS

It has long been known that Japanese education falls short of giving students
sufficient information about tones and intonations. The Japan Foundation (2009, p.
103) points out that many institutions do not attach imporance to teaching lexical
tones. This aligns with some textbooks including Genki, which seems to make a
deliberate choice of not showing lexical tones due to variations (including regional

and generational), as noted by the following:

“This textbook does not indicate a word's accents. The accent of a Japanese word
varies considerably, depending on region, the speaker's age (including the
generation gap between speakers), the word's inflections, and its connection with
other words in the sentence. Therefore, there is no need to be overly concerned
about accent, but try to imitate as closely as possible the intonation heard on the

accompanying audio aids.” (Genki1, 2nd ed. p. 20.)

Lexical tone and inotnations are imporant components of the phonological
structure, but they are taught only briefly if at all, or taught through the

problematic traditional level tone theory.

A separate section is in preparation to discuss why the level tone account is problematic. For
the issue put into the context of Japanese education, Hasegawa (1995) is convincing and
concise.

Kyouro allows teachers and textbook authors to formally represent the lexical tones
and intonation components of a sentence in a sophisticated, more objective
manner. Since it relies less on the learned “intuition” that the traditional account is

based on, it can be more intuitive to the second language Japanese speakers.

LEAVING OBSCURE SYNTACTIC BOUNDARIES OBSCURE

The conventional teaching does not teach (much) syntax. This issue is not specific
to Japanese education. As it is often said, learning a language is different from
studying linguistics. This adage is used as an excuse for not teaching linguistic
structures (especially syntax) to the students. You study Japanese because you want

to use it and speak it, not because you want to be a linguist. This may be practical.

The consequences of ignoring syntax may vary. If an English speaking student is
studying German, the problem may be a relatively less serious. English and German
syntaxes share some similarities. The German spelling employs notoriously long
compound nouns, and words are generally spaced. This makes syntactic structure
relatively transparent. (Think of Chinese. You cannot tell if a five-character
sentence is one word or five unless you know the vocabulary and the grammar. In

German, a long noun is written as an unbroken sequence of letters.)

In this regard, Japanese is closer to Chinese than German. The Japanese
orthography does not contain spaces between syntactic entities. A sentence is
written without a break. This makes it difficult for the student to parse a sentence

correctly.

In Kyouro, a sentence is spelled in such a way that it is clear what tokens it consists
of. The syntactic status of each token is broadly marked by spaces and a few special
symbols. With each token clearly represented with its phonological and syntactic
properties, the meaning of a sentence can be more easily deduced from the

propertis of tokens present.

DESIGN PRINCIPLES

THE HIERARCHY OF DESIGN PRINCIPLES

Beginner           How do | type this on the smartphone?
How do | pronounce this?
Why do | pronounce this this way?
Why do | use this form?

Advanced         What forms are possible and what aren't?

The design principles of Kyouro can be summarized as the typeability principle, the
pronounceability principle, and the parseability principle. These principles are

prioritized in the order given: typing first, pronunciation second, and parsing last.

The typeability principle requires that the learner can easily guess from Kyouro
spelling the keystrokes to get the correct orthographic form on screen. It has to be
spelled as it is typed. An average layperson who speaks General American natively
and knows nothing about Japanese should be able to guess and type in the
sentence correctly (but not necessarily choose the conversion candidate correctly).
By setting the bar to type Japanese so low, it intends to provide the potential learner
with an easy way to write her choice of phrases before even starting to study
Japanese. Since the Japanese input systems predict the correct conversion
candidate most of the time, just knowing the keystrokes can allow the user to type

Japanese correctly. It potentially lowers the initial burden of learning Japanese.

The pronounceability principle contends that a simple set of rules must deduce the
phonetic form from Kyouro spelling. The student should be able to see how the
sentente is pronounced without memorizing ad-hoc rules. The spelled and
phonetic forms however do not have a one-to-one correspondence. Many spelling
forms can correspond to the same phonetic form. While the principle demands that
the phonetic form can be deduced from the spelling, the reverse deduction is not

expected. The same pronunciation can be obtained from multiple spelling forms.

Astronaut
The parseability principle is that the phonological, syntactic, and semantic
properties of a unit form must be reasonably reflected in the spelling. The
composition of a sentence must be to a reasonable degree transparent from the

representation.

These major principles are implemented in the spelling system in the order of
priority given above. That is, when two or more of the three major principles

compete, the one with the higher priority has its way.

BROAD DESIGN PRINCIPLES OUTSIDE OF THE HIERARCHY

Kyouro shall not replace existing writing systems: It is mainly intended to be used
alongside the full orthography of Japanese although it is also reasonable to
occasionally use Kyouro without a parallel text. It is not intended to teach Japanese
only with Kyouro or to use Kyouro as the everyday writing system. Kyouro is
designed to help students learn how to write and read the standard orthography.
Perhaps its role is somewhat analogous to yomigana. It tells you how to pronounce
and how to type. Kyouro’s spelling rules should be designed so that information
that can be easily extracted from the usual orthography is not contained in the

Kyouro spelling.

Change spelling as slowly as possible: As the theory develops, analyses often
demand some of the previously accepted spelling forms be modified. Since as a
spelling system stability is favored, when two analyses are nearly equally
compelling, the one that makes smaller or fewer changes in spelling should be

adopted.

Use fewer scary symbols: It is important to keep the spelling less scary for the
student and the teacher. When two analyses are nearly equally compelling, the one
that uses fewer scary symbols should be adopted. Also, new spelling rules reducing

the use of scary symbols are more favored than the ones that increase it.

Don't run after two hares: If multiple phonetic realizations of the same written

form are interchangeable, complicating the rules or the theory is necessary only if

none of them can be sufficiently represented in the given version of Kyouro. If one

is caught, let go of the others.

Put a burden of ten on the teacher if it means lifting a burden of one from the
student: A possible criticism of Kyouro is that it is often too difficult to write. That it
is difficult to write is partly intentional. It is designed to be difficult to write, but

easy to read. After all, it is a spelling system to help learners.

It is intended that the written form reflects the best effort to analyze the language
as formally and rationally as possible so that cultural background is not required to
learn Japanese. When teaching a language to a non-native speaker, since cultural
intuition or common sense cannot be relied upon, everything must be done
formally and objectively. The speller is responsible for providing the student with
the best analysis of the language, as a direct component of the spelling or
otherwise, to make learning easier and smoother, even if the effect is minimal.
Kyouro is difficult precisely because human languages are difficult to objectively

characterize.

LETTERS AND SYMBOLS

TYPED SYMBOLS

Segments are written as it is typed. While in typical input systems, both the
kunreishiki system and the Hepburn system are allowed for the most part, in
Kyouro kunreishiki style is adopted where possible, with certain exceptions

mentioned separately.

The primary reference system is currently the iPadOS’s default Japanese input
method, but it has been designed to be compatible with Windows as well. Other

major systems may be added in the future. See also p. sweetheart.

NON-TYPED SYMBOLS

The following non-alphabetic symbols are used. These symbols are ignored when

typing the orthographic Japanese. Inside the parentheses are the unicode names.

Autumn
・ (modifer letter vertical line): The upper accent. The phonetically ‘active’ accent NUMBERS

responsible for the surface tones.
Numeric symbols (1, 2, 3, etc) are not used. Numbers are spelled out whenever

PROSODY
PROSODIC STRUCTURE

The prosodic hierarchy

Kyouro recognizes the following prosodic units: the mora, the
syllable, the accent phrase (AP), the intonation phrase (IP), and the
sentence. They constitute strict layers in the order given above (from
the smallest to the largest). Each non-terminal prosodic unit contains
a whole number of prosodic units that are exactly one level lower. In
the hierarchy, the mora is the lowest level and is the terminal
prosodic unit.

A sentence consists of a whole number of intonation phrases; an
intonation phrase consists of a whole number of accent phrases; an
accent phrase consists of a whole number of syllables; and a syllable
consists of a whole number of moras.

The use of these symbols as well as the basic understanding of the
tonal system and the prosodic structure of Japanese is largely based
on Kodama (2008). The difference between the present Kyouro
account and his original account will be noted where it matters. A
subsection to discuss the details of Kodama’s prosodic hierarchy is in
preparation. To note some obvious changes, Kodama’s p-phrase is
called the IP and Kodama’s p-word is called the AP; in Kodama’s
system, the mora is not explicitly mentioned as part of the hierarchy
but we use the term mora to refer to a prosodic unit that belongs to
and is exactly one level lower than a syllable in the prosodic
hierarchy.

The mora

A mora bears one of the three contrastive contour tones: the rising
tone (R), the level tone (Lv), and the falling tone (F). R and Lv can be
grouped by the symbol nF, which stands for “non-falling.”

The allocations of nF and F are lexical. A lexical item may have
accents. The position of accents in an AP determines which moras of
the AP receive nF and which receive F.

The occurrence of R as opposed to Lv is determined by the syntactic
structure and the information structure of the sentence. A sentence
however must have at least one R mora.

These tones, R, Lv, and F, play a major role in characterizing the
prosodic units below the sentence level.

The syllable

A syllable bears a whole number of moras. It consists of the onset and
the rhyme. The onset is made of zero to two consonants and does not
bear a contrastive tone in the phonetic form. The rhyme consists of an
optional onglide, an obligatory nucleus (usually a vowel, but
marginally a syllabic nasal), and an optional offglide. The rhyme
bears up to two moras and corresponding tones.

benevolence
The accent phrase (AP)

An AP consists of a whole number of syllables. It begins with one or
more consecutive nF moras and ends with zero or more consecutive F
moras. An nF mora cannot intervene in a sequence of F moras and
neither can an F mora intervene in a sequence of nF moras.
Consequently, if an nF mora follows an F mora, there must be an AP
boundary in between.

If an AP ends with an nF mora, the AP boundary can be phonetically
not apparent. This is a direct consequence of the fact that an AP takes
the shape nF1Fo (“one or more nF’s and following zero or more F's”).

Between two APs, a boundary fall may be found. A boundary fall can
appear at certain syntactic boundaries if the preceding AP ends with
an nF mora.

The intonation phrase (IP)

An IP consists of a whole number of APs. It has an R mora on the
nucleus of the first syllable if that is the last syllable containing an nF
in the AP. Otherwise, it has R moras through the second mora’s
syllable’s nucleus’ first mora. No other moras can be R within the
same IP.

Kyouro’s IP corresponds to Kodama’s (2008) p-phrase.

The sentence

A sentence consists of a whole number of IPs. It has at least one
predicative intonation. The predicative intonations are relevant to
whether the sentence is declarative, interrogative, etc.

The sentence as a prosodic unit is expected to correspond to the
syntactic sentence.

One or more prosodic levels between the IP level and the sentence
level may be confirmed as a result of more thorough phonetic and
phonological analyses, but the current version of Kyouro does not
recognize any intermediate levels in its spelling.

TONES AND INTONATIONS

R

The R tone is given to the sequence from the beginning through the
second mora’s syllable’s nucleus’ first mora within the initial AP’s nF
sequence of an IP. If the second mora belongs to the first syllable—
this happens when the onset contains two consonants or at least one
long consonant—or the IP’s nF sequence is only one syllable long, the
R tone is given to the first syllable’s nucleus only.

The R tone at the beginning of a word may be difficult to pay
attention to. The R tone is utterance-initially obligatory. When a
native speaker introspects into the shape of a word, she inevitably
introspects into what an utterance that contains it sounds like. Since
an utterance imposes certain tonal or intonation components on
words, including the R tone, a simple introspection fails to separate
one component from the other components of the utterance and
therefore fails to discern what components belong to the word shape.

The mechanisms determining the placement of R are explained later
in this chapter and Chapter Six. A reader who speaks natively or
fluently a variation of Japanese that shares the basic tonal and
intonation system with our reference dialect can examine his own
speech and test what tonal phenomena most resemble the R tone
described here.

The R tone has been informally or implicitly known in the literature
for several decades. In the level tone account, one aspect of the R tone
has been known as the “initial lowering” (e.g., Selkirk, et. al. 2003),
which refers to the fact that a phrase normally begins with a low-
pitched mora followed by a high-pitched mora (LH) unless the first
mora is accented. It has also been claimed by many that when the
first syllable of the phrase is heavy the initial lowering is canceled or,
as per Beckman & Pierrehumbert (1986), weakened and the pitch
contour will be HH (a high-pitched mora followed by another high-
pitched mora) or a weak L followed by an H.

Several phonetic studies (Sugito 1969, P&B 1986, Kori 2004,
Maekawa 2018, among others) exhibit a rising pitch contour in the
first one or two moras of a phrase. It seems that the traditional view
interpreted this type of rising pitch contour as either LH or HH
depending on its position and length relative to moras.

The phonological nature of R as opposed to Lv is described in
Kodama (2008) and, in a different notation, Kori (2008a). Kori’s
(2008a) view is that the rising pitch contour is of the default word
tone and it is suppressed under certain semantic contexts. This
observation is reinterpreted in Kyouro and will be explained in
Chapter Six.

blank
LV

The Lv tone is characterized by its relatively flat pitch contour. When
the starting pitch is high enough, typically, consecutive Lv moras are
pronounced with a gradual lowering of the pitch.

It is important not to confuse the Lv tone with the high tone that is
supposed in the traditional level tone account. In the level tone
account, the intonation components and lexical tone components are
conflated and both are treated in terms of high and low; the
consecutive R tones at the top of an intonation phrase are treated as a
sequence LH, and a single R tone as a single H.

The level tone account fails to capture certain phonological contrasts
when multiple APs are present in the same IP.

F

F is the falling tone contrasted with nF. The placement of F and nF is
lexical, and the F tone is observed at the end of words such as:

。 haru (nF-F) (‘spring’)

。 aruku (nF-nF-F) (‘to walk’)

。 tatsu (nF-F) (‘to stand up’)

But it is not observed anywhere in words such as:
e ashi (nF-nF) (‘foot’)

e uma (nF-nF) (‘horse’)

¢ yama (nF-nF) (‘mountain’)

。 warau (nF-nF-nF) (‘to laugh’)

s suwaru (nF-nF-nF) (‘to sit’)

The following are examples of words that have multiple F moras:
¢ gengo (nF-F-F) (‘language’)

。 minamiaoyama (nF-nF-nF-nF-nF-F-F) (Minami-Aoyama’)

。 magunichudo (nF-F-F-F-F-F) (‘magnitude’)

The F tone can be understood as the default tone. If neither Lv nor R
is given to a mora, the mora receives the F tone.

An F mora is characterized by its falling pitch contour. In a sequence
of two or more F moras, the pitch will continue to fall smoothly
throughout the sequence. If the pitch is already extremely low at the
beginning of an F mora, the falling pitch contour may not be clearly
realized. It seems that for some people an F after an nF is more
noticeable than an F after another F.

BOUNDARY FALL

This subsection is written in a new style.

A boundary fall can be inserted among other places between the Ai and Aq

syntactic boundaries.

The precise phonetic nature of the boundary fall is yet to be described. Although
far from conclusive, lida (2021) found a greater pitch fall in an F-F heavy syllable
right after an accent nucleus compared to an nF-nF syllable in the same
position. More thorough measurements and analyses are called for. Minimal
triplets such as umakatta “it was good (skillful),” uma katta “bought a horse,” and
uma katta “raised a horse” demand that the boundary fall be recognized as a

phonological component.

An example of a boundary fall can be seen in the following image. The image was
produced in April 2025 with Praat 6.3.16, running on the MacBook Air (M2), from a
voice recording of “uma katta” (“bought a horse”), “umakatta” (“it was good
(skillful)”), and “uma katta” (“raised a horse”), read aloud with a shirt sleeve placed
on my mouth, captured by the built-in mic of the computer and Praat’s built-in
voice recorder (mono, sampling frequency at 14100Hz).

The expected pitch contour of these phrases, phonologically, are R-R]Lv-(Lv)-Lyv, R-
R-F-(F)-F, and R-R|Lv-(F)-F, respectively. The boundary fall, here symbolized as ], is
allegedly seen as the falling or lowered pitch contour of the third moras of the first
and the third phrases, whose vowel, a, is shown between the two bright areas of the

spectogram corresponding to the two oral stop consonants, k and tt.

The audio file used to produce this image is available in the Praat collection file named “April
2025 umakatta.Collection” along with the older “umakatta triplet 2025.Collection” under the

“data” folder of the same repository: https://github.com/NihongoTopics/Kyouro/.

The boundary fall as a phonological and phonetic phenomenon contrasted with
contour tones in Tokyo Japanese has, to my knowledge, never been explicitly
proposed in the literature before Kyouro. Implicit or indirect indications of the

boundary fall, however, have been known for several decades.

The boundary fall was initially proposed as part of the theory of Kyouro (2018-
present), then called Atarashii Romaji, literally, “the new romaji.” The phenomenon
was Called pitchino danzetsu or “discontinuation of pitch” (although Kyouro at the
time was even more poorly documented than today, it was expressed in some of my

tweets, e.g., https://x.com/awesomenewways/status/1056069082301259776).

I initially considered the phenomenon as being esseintially about the pitch contour not
following the expected trajectory where it otherwise would keeps smoothly falling as,
metaphorically, the gravity dictates and thus included the cases where the two adjecent F
moras are in question. As I was initially unaware of Kodama (2008), the dichotomy between F
and nF was not employed. This concept of the “discontinuation of pitch” was explained in my
Kyoiku Romaji Guidebook (June 2018 edition) (2018) available at https://drive.google.com/
drive /folders/1XuLXIX--F6Yp8QoizizcSPnmdAsEjesL.

Later, in lida (2019), I changed the term to the current kyokai kako or the boundary fall and

revised the notion to be specifically about two adjacent nF moras with an explicit mention of
Kodama's (2008) F and nF.

Kawakami (1985) notes that hana takashi, where hana means “flower,” accompanies
a steep pitch fall over the word boundary with or without a following rising pitch
contour, citing Kawakami (1953, 1963). This is a clear indication that, according to

his introspection, a falling contour can occur where two nonfalling moras abut.

Hattori (1961) compares the surface forms of buta kau and inu kau. He transcribes

them as the following:

| Lbul takau|~|Lburta'l kau |

[LifmuLkau]~[Lifnutkalu]~[Lifnu'TkaLu]

(Hattori (1961), p. 195. Incompatible symbols are substituted with graphic equivalents.)

Again, these examples show that a falling contour can occur in the middle of or
over adjacent nonfalling moras and it contrasts with a relatively flat pitch contour

that occurs otherwise (e.g., “taka” in the first example’s first possible realization).

It is not clear why he did not insert a low-tone symbol between ka and u in the first example.
Since the first mora ka is in a high tone, the lowness of the second mora of the word should
have no problem realizing phonetically. In the next page (p. 196), he writes the phonemic
form of this example as /|buta|ka”u/, where the would-be pitch fall is clearly indicated by the
symbol “".” The assumed phonemic form of kau is identical as the one in inu kau, which
is /)inu'|ka”u/. Regardless, the point is he transcribed a falling tone in (or at the end of) the
second mora of inu whose corresponding position of buta is in a simple mid or high tone.

brightness
Note that this type of falling pitch contour cannot be equated with the F tone found
after the nucleus. The nucleus of inu is at the second mora as indicated in Hattori’s
aforementioned phonemic notation. Since this form contrasts with forms with the
nucleus at the first mora such as kau (/ka"u/ in Hattori’s notation), there must be

some way to distinguish an nF mora pronounced with an allegedly falling pitch

contour ( [「] in Hattori’s notation) from the usual F mora such as the second mora
of kau. That is, nF-nF|nF (eg. Zzz kau) and nF|F-nF (eg., kaw inu) are
distinguished.

In Hattori (1961), the equivalent of the nucleus is called the karnel and is indicated by the
symbol “”.

In this subsection we use the contour tone notation as faithfully as possible to Kodama’s
(2008) original notation, but to aid visual parsing, hyphens are inserted.

Some may suspect that nF|nF is an equivalent of nF|F and therefore nF-nF|nF vs.
nE |F-nF is a pseudo-problem. In fact, under the level tone account, nF |nF and nF|F

are notationally equated: uu.

If nF]nF could be equated with nFIE, the contrast between nF-nF|nF and nF]F-nF
would become trivial as they could be rewritten as nF-nF]F and nF]F-nF. It will be

shown that they are not equivalents.

Kodama (2008) illustrates that nF|nF and nF|F contrast. He proposed that the
shape of the AP can be generalized as the following:

nF+|F+ (ygん type)

nF+ | (odaka type)

nF+ (heiban type)

where “+” indicates succession (nF+ reads “one or more nF's in succession”) and “]”
indicates a lower tone on the right (nF]nF reads “a sequence of two nF moras where
the latter is lower than the former”) and is placed right after the nucleus. That is,

every AP in Tokyo Japanese takes the shape of one of the three types (p. 28, p. 33).

Since an utterance is a sequence of APs (p. 5), both of these sequences are possible:

nF |nF
nF|F
To illustrate that they are contrastive, he puts forth three possible pronunciations of

tsukini sen’en | tsuki nisen’en (“a thousand yen per month"/two thousand yen per

month”) as examples:

RLv]|(nF)(nF)+ “a thousand yen per month”
RLv]|F(nF)+ “a thousand yen per month”

RLv]|(nF)+ “two thousand yen per month”
(Examples taken from p. 29.)

Kodama (2008) transcribes IPs with R consistently placed only on the first mora for the
“default” pronunciation. This is one of the differences between his original notation and mine.

Under my introspection, the first one is acceptable only with a paralinguistic prominence on
ni. | have not inquired of him whether this judgment of mine differs from his observation.
Regardless, his claim is that in these examples nF and F contrast after ].

The second and third pronunciations demonstrate the validity of the claim. nF and

F contrast after | in these examples.

As we have now established that F and nF contrast after |, it is readily that nF-
nF|nF vs. nF]F-nF is a real contrast; nF] and F contrast before nF. (We do not worry

about | before F as we will see later.)

In sum, before nF, F + nF], nF] = nF, and F = nF; all three are contrastive. This

necessitates contour tones and the boundary tone indicated by “|” simultaneously.

That F + nF before nF is assumed to be trivial as there would be no disputes here, e.g., lklk
vs. UM. (Kori (2008a) and Kori (2004) are relevant.)

Notice that in Kodama’s (2008) formulation a sequence of an nF mora and the
following F mora is always written as nF|F. nF-F never occurs. Hence, | here is

redundant and can be safely ignored.

This leads to another difference between Kodama’s (2008) and my notations; I replace
Kodama’s nF]F with nF-F.

] is not redundant between nF moras as we have just established above that nF]nF

and nF-nF contrast.

bunnies
] never appears in other places—except utterance-finally, in which case, by
definition, it cannot be phonetically realized as itself. No matter how yukaku,

odaka, and heiban are arranged, neither F|F nor F|nF can occur.

Thus, the only place where | matters is between nF's, which is where an instance

of | is called the boundary fall. The boundary fall is a special case of Kodamas |.

This subsection laid out some theoretical background of the boundary fall. To give

some concrete examples, the following sentences include a boundary fall:

souda, taka ra saga s・a nakya.
(TRICK, ep. 10, 00:38:37)
§Ueda-Wants-Treasure

ku tu yogo re rru kara 1 ya.
(TRICK 3, ep. 2, 00:14:39)

PREDICATIVE INTONATIONS

This subsection is written in a new style.
Certain types of simple predicates are understood as part of a question if the final
mora is pronounced with a rising tone at its later half. In the following example, the
intonation associated with interrogation is marked by the symbol R% (R stands for
“rising”).

kino nani tabeta (R%) — What did you eat yesterday?

R% can co-occur with the final mora’s F tone without neutralizing it with nF.

ashita yotei aru (R%) — Do you have any plans tomorrow?
Aru is nF-F. Compare:

kyo mizugi iru (R%) — Do we need a swimsuit today?
Iru is nF-nF.

R% coexisting with F on the same mora after nF is found, among other times, when

no follows an nF predicate (iru in the following example).

kyo mizugi iru no (R%) — Because we need a swimsuit today?

We will come back to this point later in this section.

The corresponding declarative predicate does not accompany a rising intonation.
In this sense, the intonation at the end of the predicate is contrastive. In a
declarative sentence, the last few syllables, especially the final one, receive

additional steepness (marked by F%):

kino gomasaba tabeta (F%) 一 I ate gomasaba yesterday.

Kori (2008b, 2011) provides a detailed phonetic analysis of the added pitch drop at the end of
a declarative sentence.

The F% intonation can be difficult to pay attention to. The following YouTube video includes
an exemplary instance of how the absence of F% at the end of a plain declarative sentence
makes the sentence unnatural. In the video, a man says, “Boku wa hitono shi 0 jiyuni ayatsuru
koto ga dekiru.” without an F% intonation at the end. The sentence rather sounds like an
attributive clause of a larger sentence: https://youtu.be/PIbCqmvAiNI?feature=shared

The R% intonation can appear in the middle of a sentence. The predicate of a
question is typically positioned at the end, but when it is placed elsewhere, the R%
intonation arises at the same place. In the following example, the predicate is

placed in the middle due to inversion.

nani tabeta (R%) kino — What did you eat yesterday?

There seems to be no accepted single orthographic standard as to where the question mark
should be placed in the case of inversion. My impression as an everyday speaker is that the
most natural position is after the predicate, but I would not be surprised if a significant
minority places the question mark at the end and puts a comma after the predicate.

The typical pronunciation of the sentence above has an IP that consists of tabeta
(R%) kino. It includes the R% intonation in the middle. This would raise a question
as to what component of the prosodic hierarchy the intonation belongs to. Some
may speculate that the intonation belongs to AP. The following example, however,

demonstrates that it can even intervene in an AP (unitalicized).

ashita omatsuri iku (R%) tte kikareta kara — because (he) asked me, ‘Are you
going to the festival tomorrow?’

I speculate, without much confidence, that the other type of the predicative
intonation, F%, can be subject to the same phenomenon where it intervenes in a
prosodic unit smaller than or equal to the sentence when inversion or direct

quotation is involved, but the effect, if any, is much less obvious than R%.

ashita omatsuri iku, watashi — Tm going to the festival tomorrow.

candle
gomasaba tabeta, kino — I ate gomasaba yesterday.
gomasaba tabeta tte itteta — (he) said he had eaten gomasaba.

When a predicative intonation intervenes in a sentence, the sentence can have
multiple predicative intonation components. (This is most likely obligatory since
there is no apparent reason—empirical or otherwise—to assume that having one

in the middle lifts the one at the end.)

nani tabeta (R%) kino (F%) — What did you eat yesterday?

In this case, since kino here is clearly not a predicate, the final F% may be better called a
sentential intonation. The distinction, however, is inessential to our discussion.

ashita omatsuri iku (R%) tte kikareta kara (F%) — because (he) asked me, ‘Are

you going to the festival tomorrow?’

The effect is easier to see if the final intonation is R%.
ashita omatsuri iku (R%) tte kikareta (R%) — Did (he) ask you, ‘Are you going to
the festival tomorrow?’?

Summarizing our observations so far, the predicative intonations 1. can appear in
the middle of a sentence, an IP, or even an AP; 2. can appear in multiple places of a
sentence; and 3. are obligatory at least in one place per sentence. There seems to be
no obvious, simple, strict rules governing the position and occurrence of these
intonations with respect to the prosodic hierarchy, other than that a sentence must

have at least one predicative intonation somewhere.
Certain types of interrogative predicates do not have R%.

watashiwa do sureba tin deshoka (F%) — What would you think I should do?

Some declarative sentences have R%, but it is limited to certain particles.

kuwashiku shirabenaito ikemasen ga, osoraku sotokara mottekita mono da to
omoimasu yo (R%)

(TRESEID ZEA.)

This yo (R%) is accented (nF) as we can infer from the following:

nande tabenai no? oishii (-nF) yo (R%) — Why aren't you eating? It’s delicious.

yoru wa raito tsukenaito abunai (-nF) yo (nF, R%) — At night, it’s unsafe if you
don’t turn on the lights.

In each, the predicate before yo (nF, R%) is a member of kino group (»harmonica).
Hence, the fact that oishii and abunai are both nF for their final mora implies that
the following item yo (R%) is accented (nF). This can be compared with another yo

(often explained in terms of “emphasis”), unaccented (F):

yoru wa raito tsukenaito abunai (-F) yo (F, F%) — At night, it’s unsafe if you don't
turn on the light.

gyoza wa shoyu tsukenakutemo oishii (-F) yo (F, F%) — Gyoza is delicious even
without soy sauce.

And no (F):
yoru wa raito tsukenaito abunai (-F) no (F, F%) — Because at night, it’s unsafe if
you don’t turn on the light.

yoru wa raito tsukenaito abunai (-F) no (F, R%) — Because at night, it’s unsafe if
you don’t turn on the light?

As shown, the predicate abunai and oishii receives an F tone at the end when
followed by F, regardless of whether the predicative intonation given to the

unaccented item is F% or R%.

The fact that no is unaccented even with R can be easily observed with examples

such as the following:

ashita omatsuri iku no (F, R%) — Because you are going to the festival
tomorrow?

Compare:

ashita omatsuri iku ko (nF, R%) — Is (he) the kid who is going to the festival
tomorrow?

Clearly, nF and F are contrastive even with R%.
But the contrast becomes less clear after F:

wakaru (-F) yo (nF, R%) 一 I understand that.

wakaru (-F) no (F, R%) — Because you understand that?

charisma
The difference between them in the pitch contours is slim at best (my
introspection, December 2023). Whether and how they differ must be investigated
phonetically. But that yo (R%) is phonologically always nF can be inferred from the
fact that yo (F, R%) is never allowed after nF:

“iku (-nF) yo (F, R%)
“iru (-nF) yo (F, R%)
*asoko da (nF) yo (F, R%)

I initially overlooked this fact and in a privately shared earlier version of this document and
potentially in other older documents recklessly stated that yo (nF, R%) and yo (F, R%) are
contrastive. I hereby correct the error: they are not contrastive. The cause of the error was that
I had introspected into two possible phonetic forms of oishii yo, one of which has oishii with
the final mora F. I am not aware of evidence strong enough to claim that, despite the
observations we have just made above, these two forms differ in the phonological tone of yo.
Phonetically the clearest difference is at the final moras of oishii. The supposed difference in
meaning (F R% for “to elicit confirmation” and nF R% for “to elicit attention”) could be
paralinguistic, and there will be no explanation for why this form of yo can appear after oishii
and not after ikeru, for example. I suppose if these two forms of oishii before yo in fact
contrast, it will be necessary to account for the difference by some other means.

Yo (nF, Lv%) is related to making announcements. The vowel part of it tends to be
long, in which case it is denoted here as yo. (Compare this with the case of yo7e
mentioned later in this section.) The intonation symbol Lv% refers to the fact that

it is perceptually level.

mosugu heiten desu yo (nF, Lv%) 一 The store will be closing soon.
iku yo (nF, Lv%) — Here I go! (throwing a ball)
Ne, sometimes translated as “right?” or “isn’t that so?? is pronounced as a whole IP
(indicated by capitalization):
Oishii Ne. — It’s delicious, isn’t it? (declarative)
§Isn't-It-Delicious

Kawaii Ne. — It’s cute, isn’t it? (declarative)
§lsn't-It-Cute

Native speakers often broadly describe the intonation given to ne as a “rising”

intonation, but the following sentences have the same phonetic shapes as above:

Oishii Ne. — It’s a delicious root.
§It’s-Delicious-Root

Kawaii Ne. — It’s a cute root.
§lt’s-Cute-Root

The perceived rises in the pitch contours of ne in these cases are just the IP-initial R
tone. This is not considered as a predicative intonation. Some other ending
particles including ze and wa, which are used in a masculine speech and a feminine

speech, respectively, fall into the same class as ne.

One-mora IP’s like ne (‘root’), te (‘hand’), e (‘drawing’), etc. can have R%:
Oishii Ne (R%) — Is it a delicious root?
Okina Te (R%) — Is it a big hand?
Kireina E (R%) — Is it a beautiful drawing?

Some ending particles are prosodically complex. Yone (related to “confirmation”)
has the second mora in its own IP and accented and the first mora in the preceding
IP is unaccented (which means yo belongs to the preceding AP). At first glance the
fact that yo is part of the IP of the preceding word may seem unclear. If the
beginning of yo coincides with the IP’s left edge, yo must be nF by definition, which
means the latter half of a long vowel at the end of yone’s preceding AP must be able
to be nF without a problem. However, oishii yone is obligatorily pronounced with
the latter half of ii in F. Hence, it must be that the mora yo belongs to the same AP

as oishii and yone has an IP boundary in the middle.

When yone (not guaranteed to be the same item as the aforementioned yone) is
used in a question, it receives a characteristic rising-falling intonation, tentatively

represented here as RF%.

kono heyade atteru yone (RF%) — This room is the correct one, right?
(interrogative )

clover
Perceptually the final syllable ne (RF%) is longer than it would be with F%. The

perceptual length is sometimes represented in the orthography with an added

vowel letter (よねえ ? ), often small (よねえ? ), although it is probably more

common to not mark the length directly, only leaving the question mark (よね ? ).

In fact, if it is two moras, the impressionistic description of RF%—the first half is
rising and the second half falling—will be understood as just F% with the first mora
bearing the IP-initial R. If this assumption is correct, the above example can be

rewritten as:

kono heyade atteru yoné (F%) — This room is the correct one, right?
(interrogative )
For now, we assume that this intonation is just a phonetic realization of F% when

the relevant syllable has a long vowel and is its own IP.

Kino group items at the end of a sentence allow multiple pronunciations for some
speakers. For these speakers, including myself, oishii, for example, can be
pronounced with the final mora in F or nF. Other speakers seem to consistently
prefer only one of the two forms of the same item. It would not be unreasonable to
suspect that these two forms contrast. For now, I refrain from suggesting one
conclusion over the other. In this version of Kyouro, the said potential intonational
contrasts are not indicated. Oishii at the end of a sentence is written as ors1n

regardless of whether it is pronounced with or without an F tone at the end.

The utterance-final tone inflicted by the suffix -yo of the verb paradigm needs
attention. In the following examples, the relevant items are unitalicized.

tsugi au toki wa chigau kachikande mina de odoro.

(PUNPEE “Gizmo (Future Foundation).”)
§Gizmo-Future-Foundation

tsugino jikanni mo minna de kangaeyo ze.
(丘の家のミッキー+:.)
§ Tsuru-Why-Sexes
The predicates odoro and kangaeyo can be pronounced with R%, but the forms
with F% and R% are pragmatically distinct. The latter—henceforth the “suggestive”
-yo—is often written in the orthography with a question mark (?). When they are

pronounced with R%, the pitch contour will be similar to that of a kino group item,

such as yasashii and oishii.

At first glance, this may seem like the familiar tone alternation of kino group items,
but the -yo form of a verb does not belong to kino group. One indication is that, in
kangaeyo ne, the part -yo must be pronounced with F. This differs from yasashii ne
and oishii ne, where the final moras of yasashii and oishii can be pronounced with
nF. Consequently, the “suggestive” -yo is a separate phonological from the

imperative -yo.

Additionally, potentially contrastive is a perceptually Lv% form of the “suggestive”
-yo. While the phonological standing of this form remains unclear, orthographically,
this form does not receive a question mark (?) where the corresponding R% form
often does. Precise semantic descriptions aside, they are conventionally

distinguished by laypeople.

Summarizing our investigation so far, the predicative intonations can be classed

into the following three categories:

- F%: simple declarative sentences and interrogative sentences with certain

predicate types, and potentially some others.

・ Lv%: declarative sentences with certain ending particles, some of the -yo forms,

and potentially some others.

- R%: simple interrogative sentences and declarative sentences with certain

ending particles, and potentially some others.

The following chart summarizes the functions of these intonations (F%, Lv%, and

R%) for each context.

As shown, none of the predicate contexts clearly utilize a ternary (F%-Lv%-R%)
contrast. Although further investigations may reveal a three-way (four-way
including attributive) contrast somewhere in the system, for now, we assume that
in each context, the predicative intonation is binary (ternary including attributive).
Since as a native speaker I feel that the perceptually salient category is R%, here I
assume the contrast is between nR% (non-rising, that is, either Lv% or F%) and R%

and reorganize the chart accordingly.

Syllable structure

The syllable structure is maximally CCGVG. The onglide (the first G)
can only be y. The offglide (the second G), when present, is n or 7 or
marginally e or u, where n is a nasal glide which is realized as a stop
before a stop. The vowel and at least one consonant of the onset can
be long. The onset (the CC part) and the glides are optional, but the
nucleus (V) is obligatory. Marginally, the nucleus can be a nasal stop.

The orthographic y is sometimes interpreted to be part of a palatalized
consonant. See Okada (1999) for example.

The proposed syllable structure is substantially different from some
earlier works including Okada (1999). The new approach is necessary
for accurately describing the tone allocation rules in simple terms.

In a syllable of the (C)(G)VG structure, the onset bears zero moras,
the nucleus one, and the glide one, and if the onset is complex (CC),
the first C bears one mora, provided that all segments are short.
Glides are always short and not allowed after a long vowel. The
onglide bears zero moras. A long C or V adds exactly one mora to the
corresponding spot. Denoting a long consonant as C and a long vowel
as V, both CC(G)VG and CC(G)V are four moras long, and C(G)V is
two moras long. A five-mora syllable is dubious, but I refrain from
judging it impossible for now. An example of a four-mora syllable is
the second syllable (-kkitat) of hikkitai [hik:dar| ‘the cursive form.’

Correction in 5.2.0: CC(G)V is three moras. I thank @triethylamineq for
pointing this out.

When the symbols C and V stand for consonants and vowels, the distinction
between long and short segments are not always made. In most other places
in this book (e.g., p. ditheism), long and short segments are denoted by C and
V without a macron.

Tserdanelis, Beckman, Kong, Li, & Syrika (2005) as well as Hasegawa (1995)
treat Japanese “palatalized k’” as palatal. We do not discriminate between a
palatalized or fronted velar and a true palatal in our IPA transcription.

The vowel a is usually transcribed as [a], [a], or [ve]. In a natural speech, it can
be as high as [3] and occasionally it feels even as high as [5| (my
introspection). I use [a] unless the precise quality of the vowel is at issue.

It is customary to transcribe /i as [ci]. This style of transcription fails to
capture the fact that the ostensive palatal fricative [c] is only about as
constrictive as the following vowel [i] (Kuroki p.c. and my personal
observation). (Tronnier & Dantsuji 1993 provide a comparison of Japanese /
h/ and German /h/ and /c/, for both languages in the context of a following
[i], and show that the F1 value of the Japanese /h/ is greater than the German
/h/ (p. 220).) The vowel-like nature of this segment will be correctly captured
if [h] is used instead. In fact, [h] often resembles the neighboring vowels. It is
appropriately interpreted as a glide, something that is vowel-like and
nonvocalic, in Chomsky & Halle (1968), p. 303. Japanese h does not seem to
be an exception of this usual behavior of the so-called glottal fricative. The
sequence ho in a word such as toho ‘on foot’ is typically pronounced as [ho],
in which [h] is another way of representing  lo]  (informal observation).
Accordingly, [hi] as used here is a notational variant of [ii] or [ji]. By the same
token, fu will be transcribed as [hu] if necessity arises.              」

despair
The offghde 7 can follow nonfront short vowels (u, o, a) but not front
vowels (i, e) and is often found in kanji words and katakana words
(e.g., gaikoku ‘foreign country’, sairtumu ‘psyllium’) and in adjectives
(e.g., usui ‘is thin’ (-7 is a suffix.)). When it is expected to follow the
vowel 7 in an adjective stem, a phonetic long vowel [i:] appears (e.g.,
yasashii ‘kind’). The phonological behavior suggests that the offglide i
is prohibited after the nuclei 7.

In a natural speech, whether a given vocoid is a nucleus or a glide is often
unclear and sometimes they are practically neutralized. As is usually the case,
the phonetic specifications are given as abstractions that relate to physical
representations, which are affected by uncontrolled real-world factors. If two
sentences receive distinct phonetic specifications, the claim is that they
systematically differ in how they relate to physical sounds, but not necessarily
that they always sound distinct to the human ears. Also note that Kyouro’s
spelling rules are designed to be tolerant to minor analytic inconsistencies.
(See Chapter Seven.)

A potential minimal pair of the offglide e and the nucleus e arises
when the verbs kaeru ‘to go back’ and kaeru ‘to change’ (transitive),
which differ in the lexical (nF vs. F) tones in their lemmas (the forms
of dictionary headings, not necessarily the lexical forms), take suffixes
to suppress the tonal contrast: kaeraremashita (てgo back’ /‘change’}-
[+ honorific, + past]). Supposedly, if the e in the stem is a nucleus, it

is the ‘change’ verb, and the ‘go back’ otherwise (See also the note
below).

A major—and probably the most noticeable to many including myself—
phonetic difference between the two lies in the realization of the IP-initial
rising tone. The contrast suppressed by the said suffixes is of the falling tone.

kaeru                      ‘to go back’                        R-F-F

kaeru                      ‘to change’                         R-R-Lv
kaeraremashita        ‘went back (honorific)         R-Lv-Lv-Lv-Lv-F-F
kaeraremashita       ‘changed (honorific)           R-R-Lv-Lv-Lv-F-F

This is a relatively loose contrast. According to my introspection, in careful
speech the e nucleus appears in the “change” verb but not in the “go back”
verb, and the e offglide vice-versa, but in sloppy speech the e offglide can
appear in both.

Kaeru as well as phonologically similar kaesu are quite interesting both
phonologically and lexically. »exorcist. »glucose-harmonica.

The offglide u [i] can occur between a and a coronal consonant (t, ts,
d, s, z, sh, j, ch, r) (e.g., hausudasuto ‘house dust’), provided that no
syntactic boundaries intervene. Cases in which wu in the same
environment is realized as a nucleus have been found but they are
rare (e.g. naute ‘well-known,’ naushika ‘Nausicaa’ (a Studio Ghibli
animation)). The corresponding tonal difference between the two
parallels to the contexts of the other offglides—whether it is au, ae, or
ai, VG cannot be R-R. The difference in the vowel quality or
articulation is not difficult to notice when compared to the case where
the vowel u is followed by a noncoronal segment, in which case the
vowel is further back or more rounded (e.g., augusutusu ‘Augustus ).

hausudasuto           ‘house dust’                 R-Lv-Lv-Lv-F-F
augusutusu                ‘Augustus’                        R-R-Lv-Lv-F-F
naute                           ‘well-known’                    R-R-Lv

Here and elsewhere, tone marks given to voiceless moras are conveniently
assumed. In reality, voiceless segments do not exhibit phonetic tones.

An onset can be a consonant cluster. In writing, an onset cluster is
interpreted to have a voiceless high vowel in-between. The supposed
vowel in a cluster, in the following examples indicated by a
superscript vowel letter, is not very clearly pronounced if at all.

kusai                          ‘smells bad’
sukoshi                    ‘a small amount’
kitaku                      ‘arriving home’
tstkau                      ‘to use’

The sequence ‘ts’ in the Hepburn system denotes a single consonant: IPA [ts].

disinfection
Syllabification

Offglides are not allowed after a long vowel. When a segment that
would otherwise be an offglide 7 follows a long vowel, it turns into a
nucleus 1. This is observed when the adjective suffix 7 is attached to a
stem that ends with a long vowel, such as fo ‘is far.’

—> toi        CV.V       ‘is far’
If a nasal glide follows an oral offglide, typically, the rhyme breaks

and the original oral offglide turns into a nucleus. This is observed
when n (‘because’) follows the present declarative form of adjective:

chika +   i   ー> chikai   CCVG   ‘is near’
to    +   1

nF-nF-nF-F-F         |

But the pre-nasal rhyme breaking seems to be, at least under certain
condition, optional as the following pronunciation is also allowed:

| usut+i+n+da      —> u.su.in.da

nF-nF-F-F-F         |
A similar example is osanai n da (“oh, you wont push it”), which can
be nF-nF-nF-nF-F-F or nF-nF-nF-F-F-F (my introspection). A
further comparable case of the pre-nasal rhyme breaking is seen in
shinai n da as appears in:

| usu+itn+da      —> u.sui.n.da

。 konoyoni reinoryoku nante sonzai shinai n da tte
(TRICK, Ep. 7, at around 0:33:20.)

A nasal mora before a following long stop consonant (cf. nihon tte) feels like
its own syllable. The articulatory phenomena that seem to contribute to the
syllabic impression include the tongue position and the duration of oral
closure. Questions as to how this phenomenon should be characterized are
tentatively put aside. The syllabicity of a nasal mora before a long consonant
matters in cases like: kan tte “speaking of intuition,” san tte “speaking of
three,” and bon tte “speaking of the Bon festival.”

In loan words and Sino-Japanese words, the sequence ai is usually a
diphthong unless a morpheme boundary intervenes. However, when
followed by the moraic nasal, the same letter sequence is realized
disylabically:

Although the term morpheme is used here to talk about the phenomenon in
terms of the common sense, whether a sequence of vocoids is a diphthong or a
hiatus can be specified in the lexicon without referring to the traditional
notion of morpheme. In general, the notion of morpheme has no use in the
kind of a grammar we are dealing with here. For an illustration, »sky-
snapshot.

ai.do.ru            VG.CV.CV
a.in.shuta.in V.VG.CCV.VG

When a moraic nasal follows a long vowel, instead of breaking the
long vowel into two, the nasal becomes syllabic. This is observed
when the aforementioned n follows yasashiti, oishii, and other
adjective forms that have a long i (spelled as 7 in Hepburn,
pronounced as 7) at the end:

yasashii          (ya.sa.shi)           CV.CV.CV
oishii              (oi.shi)                VG.V

yasashii n da (ya.sa.shi.n.da) CV.CV.CV.V.CV
olshii n da      (oi.shi.n.da)        VG.CV.V.CV

This applies to orthographic long vowels before a moraic nasal. Gurin
(‘green’) is pronounced as gu.77.7 or CV.CV.N unless it resorts to a
vowel sequence as in gu.ri.in or CV.CV.VG. (I suggest understanding
this as a case of doublets, not of optional phonological rules.) NHK’s
pronunciation dictionary lists both possibilities of koncha (‘corn tea’):

(ko.n.cha)              CV.V.CV
(ko.on.cha)           CV.VG.CV

For the latter, the literal notation of the dictionary is as if it is koncha, but the
recorded audio is as noted here.

THE TRIANGLE CONSTRAINT

Distribution of R

Since a sentence contains one or more IPs, it must have at least one R
(or a sequence of consecutive R’s of an AP, henceforth treated without
discrimination in this section) within itself. If it has only one R, it
comes at the top.

When multiple R’s are in a sentence, their positions are restricted in
certain ways. In the following case (“Burnable garbage is collected on
Mondays.”), dashimasu can bear R only if getsuyobini does so. R is
marked by capitalizing the first letter.

In yamamoto wa katono hohoni kisu shita (“Yamamoto kissed Kato
on his cheeks”), hoho can be capitalized only if katono is, kisu only if

katono does so, and shita only if kisu.

TRIANGLE DIAGRAM

This subsection is written in a new style.

The APs in a sentence are in a dependency relationship. Consider the following

diagram.

fp ii

moeru                                           gomi wa        getsuyobini                                      dashimasu

The APs at the bottom of a triangle belong to the nearest comer. Moeru belongs to
the left corner of the dark blue triangle. Similarly, getsuyobini belongs to the left
corner of the bright blue triangle. These two triangles in turn belong to the larger

triangle behind them.

For the left corner of any one of the triangles, its AP must bear R if the triangle
contains an AP with R. If dashimasu bears R, then getsuyobini and moeru must bear
R because dashimasu is at the right comers of the bright blue triangle and the large

triangle.

Certain lexical items such as tabun, chotto, sore, etc., when used as fillers, can evade these
constraints. More investigations are necessary to correctly capture the phonological nature of
these items.

Similarly, the following triangle layers represent the text yamamoto wa katono

hohoni kisu shita and correctly capture the interdependence of its APs.

hohoni          kisu                      shita

katono

yamamoto wa

The triangle diagram satisfies the following conditions:

- Each bottom corner of a triangle corresponds to exactly one AP. (If two or more

triangles share a corner, the shared corner corresponds to one AP.)
・ There are no orphan APs. (Each AP corresponds to one of the bottom corners.)

- At most two triangles can be directly layered on top of a larger triangle. If two
triangles are directly on a larger triangle, the larger triangle’s two bottom corners

are both shared with one of the two smaller triangles.

A triangle diagram can be replaced with parentheses. The aforementioned

structures can be represented as:

((moeru gomiwa) (getsuyobini dashimasu))
(yamamotowa ((katono hohoni) (kisu shita)))

Or equivalently

moeru gomiwa getsuyobini dashimasu

yamamotowa katono hohoni kisu shita

An overline over two APs indicates the APs merge.
These are not syntactic representations. An AP is a phonological unit and is not a
terminal node of a syntactic tree. Rules to convert a syntactic representation to a

phonological representation will be discussed in Chapter Six.

CHAPTER THREE: LEXICAL FORMS

THE NATURE OF THE LEXICON

PHONOLOGY DERIVES THE PHONETIC FORM FROM THE OUTPUT OF
SYNTAX
In the previous chapter, we briefly mentioned how onset clusters are represented in

standard orthography. Here are some additional examples of words that contain

consonant clusters.

itstkushimajinja kakushin             yamashita
ikusa                   hakushikatei — tokushitsu
tokushima              mokuteki            kakuekiteisha
asakusa              kishakaiken kakusan
ishikariheiya          ftkushima           sutoraiku
kakushiki           kokuseki               kakkiteki

It is immediately apparent that the superscript vowels are uniformly bounded by
orthographic voiceless consonants. This is part of the syllable template’s

requirements. When the onset is a consonant cluster, both C’s must be voiceless.

A plosive as the second consonant of an onset tends to have a shorter (though positive) VOT
than a plosive after a voiced segment. Orthographically, both of the consonants in a cluster
are treated as voiceless. The discussion that follows in this section suggests that the
consonants in the said environment are underlyingly voiceless.

The fact that the superscript letters are limitedly distributed raises a question as to
whether the CC structures are derived or lexical. At least in some instances, CC
structures are conditioned by the following word’s initial segment, in which case it

is reasonable to think that the surface CCs are derived from underlying CVCs:
aruku + kara 一> arukukara “because you walk”

aruku + nara —> arukunara “if you walk”

although the reverse analysis (insertion) is conceivable:

aruku + kara 一> arukukara “because you walk”

aruku + nara 一> aruku nara     “if you walk”

Individuating the single most economical analysis is beyond the current scope of
Kyouro. The point to be made here is that the output of syntax is subject to
phonological rules that derive the phonetic form. Studying phonetic forms is part of
pursuing the nature of the output of syntax. Syntax builds up a structure containing
enough information for phonology to derive the phonetic form of the sentence.

Unpredictable phonetic specifications are supplied from the lexicon.

Some phonological processes are applied to a local syntactic structure. Accent
switching occurs recursively as suffixes merge recursively with the base (»globalist).
Accessing local structures is also necessary to determine the positions of R (Chapter
Six). These facts suggest that the precedence of syntax over phonology only holds
for each subprocess and it is not the case that everything in syntax completes

before phonology begins.

easter
INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE LEXICON

Unpredictable information is provided by the lexicon. This includes boundary
labels and phonological symbols as well as semantic information although
semantics is not discussed here. This information comes in a lexical item, whose
components are linked to each other so that if any partial information of a lexical
item is available for the grammar all else of the same item is also available at some
point of derivation. However, modification processes, including deletion and
alternation, are irreversible, and the same information cannot be retrieved twice to

repair what has been altered.

Phonological symbols supplied by the lexicon include segments, accents, and AP
boundaries. An AP boundary can be a boundary fall. Syntactic specifications will be

discussed in Chapters Four and Five.

Segments are organized into a sequence, which is interpreted by phonology to
derive syllable structures. Certain modification processes take place before
syllabification. Syllables are associated with moras. This syllable-mora structure

constitutes part of the prosodic hierarchy.

AP boundaries, including boundary falls, are segmental in the sense that their
positions are defined with respect to the segmental sequence. They are, however,
not pronounced as a phonetic segment and not considered as a constituent of a
syllable, and they always coincide with a syllable boundary as implied by the strict
layer hypothesis. The prosodic hierarchy completes after R allocation (Chapter Six)

is done.

The segmental standing of accents is disputable. In the Kyouro spelling, accents,
indicated by the symbols ‘and , are written in the same sequence as segments, and
a basic algorithm deriving the correct phonetic form from the spelling form is
provided (»forest). The Kyouro spelling form of an item is therefore taken to be a
fairly good approximation of the lexical form, as far as accent is concerned.
Potential problems of treating accents as segmental include the fact that some

lexical items require an accent to be placed in the middle of a bimoraic segment

(»glucose). This problem is concealed by the typeability principle: bimoraic
segments are spelled with digraphs.

Spelling form: Phonetictorm: Lexical form:

kino'u                 kino                     kinow kino, or ...?

Another potential problem is that an accent can be placed apart from the
segmental sequence. Some suffixes have an accent one mora behind its true
segmental sequence. It seems that this is the leftmost position an accent can be
placed in in the lexical form. It is not clear whether or how this should be
characterized in the segmental sequence in the lexicon. In Kyouro, items that have
an accent apart from the sequence of true segments, when spelled in isolation, are

noted with the symbol ‘(_), representing a placeholder of one mora.

Spelling form: Phonetictorm: Lexical form:

(_)r-u

A lexical item can have at most one upper accent and one lower accent per AP.

nF-{F/nF}            (_)ru, ru (2), or ...?

Each accent present in a lexical item is specified with the position. If two accents
are present in one AP, as a corollary of what is assumed about the two types of

accents, the upper accent precedes the lower accent (»generativist).

SOME WORD BOUNDARIES ARE AP BOUNDARIES

Some words do not bear an AP. What this means is exemplified by the following.

APs are separated by tab spaces.

taroga ikebanao  kansho _ shita.

§Taro-Admired-Ikebana
hanakoga fuchuio  kokai _ shita.

§Hanako-Regretted-Carelessness

basuga mokutekichini — tochakushita.

§Bus-Arrived-Destination
makkunara  iroirona kotoga kantanni  dekiru.

§Mac-Everything-Easy

Items such as ga, ni, and o do not bear an AP. They belong to the preceding word’s
AP In contrast, items such as taro, ikebana, shita, and basu bear an AP. Their left
edge always coincides with an AP boundary. Whether a given item initializes an AP
in the sentence partly depends on the syntactic standing. Items with certain
syntactic properties obligatorily initialize an AP under certain phonological
condition. Other items usually belong to the preceding word’s AP, but some of them

begin with a new AP.

If the item’s left boundary is a word boundary (see Chapters Four and Five for
details) and the item’s first AP has an accent, its left edge is an AP boundary. This AP
boundary can be accounted for by a syntax-phonology mapping rule, and therefore
it is not considered as a lexical property. Lexical specification of AP boundaries is

necessary if the item accompanies an AP boundary under other conditions.

As explained in Chapter Five, certain syntactic boundaries are classified as word
boundaries. This classification is part of the spelling design of Kyouro. Word

boundaries in the spelling form of a sentence satisfy the following conditions:
・ Word boundaries are marked by a space.

・ If there are no other spaces between a space and the first accent that follows,

upper or lower, the space corresponds to an AP boundary.

The following items, for example, accompany an AP boundary at their left edge. We
know this from the spelling because they have a word boundary on the left side and
have an accent. On the left is the phonological specifications of the item, written in
Kyouro, and on the right is the syntactic specifications. The notation of syntactic
properties is explained in Chapter Four, but for the following items, the labels
placed on the left side of the bar indicate that the item has a word boundary on the
left.

wakega = Ri |A4

rkebana  R2lm-ii

kannsyou  .|G
sl ta                    G2|R1

In contrast, the following items, despite having a word boundary on the left, belong

to the preceding items’s AP because they do not have an accent.

echo
Items that do not have a word boundary on the left, unless otherwise specified in
the dictionary, belong to the preceding word’s AP regardless of whether they have
an accent. These items are called inflectional suffixes and have an inflectional
symbol, - or > somewhere in the spelling. (Deletion rules may be applied. See

Chapter Seven.) Some of the inflectional suffixes are shown below:

SOME AP BOUNDARES ARE BOUNDARY FALLS

An AP boundary can be a boundary fall. Some boundary falls that occur between
words are predictable. Unpredictable boundary falls must be specified in the
lexicon. Kyouro’s spelling rule discriminates among different types of predictable

and lexical boundary falls. »stibine.

Unlike AP boundaries, a boundary fall is always directly shown in the spelling form
of a sentence with a boundary fall symbol, or ., regardless of whether the boundary
fall in question is predictable. The former, the upper boundary fall symbol, is used
when the corresponding boundary fall is phonetically realized. The latter, the lower

boundary fall symbol, is used when the potential boundary fall is canceled due to

the phonological environment. When a lexical item is spelled in isolation, only

lexical boundary falls are shown.

The lower boundary fall symbol does double duty. Taking advantage of the fact that
the presence of a boundary fall symbol implies an AP boundary even when the
boundary fall is canceled, the same symbol is used to indicate a lexical AP
boundary that does not accompany a boundary fall—it can be interpreted as a
potential boundary fall that just happens to never be realized due to the fixed

phonological condition.

In isolation (ie., when characterizing the token itself as opposed to a sentence
where the token appears), if the boundary fall is never or only conditionally
phonetically realized, the lower boundary fall symbol is used, and if it is always
realized phonetically, the upper boundary fall symbol is used. A space is never
inserted within a lexical item. The following are some items that are spelled with a

boundary fall symbol in isolation.

tu gl is assumed to be |A4 because per our spelling convention, a boundary fall
symbol must correspond to an AP boundary and therefore the symbol is the upper

one even in isolation.

Verbs

Consider the following:

taberu               tabeta                    tabenai
tsukiru             tsukita                   tsukinai

It seems that the forms ru, ta, and nai are inflectional suffixes.

Now consider the following:

tsukuru            tsukutta                 tsukuranai
yobu                 yonda                     yomanai

The suffix ta shows an allomorph tta in tsukutta, and in yonda it
takes the form of da. Also, the suffix ru in yobu takes the form of wu.
As we will see below, it is also reasonable to consider the phonetic ru
in tsukuru as a sequence of the last consonant r of the stem and the u
of the suffix ru.

The term “allomorph” is conveniently used to refer to any alternative phonetic
forms of a given syntactic unit.

The allomorph u appears after a consonant as observed in the
following list of verb forms.

kaku                  kaita
nugu                 nuida
hanasu             hanashita
katsu                 katta
shinu                shinda
kamu                kanda
tsukuru            tsukutta
warau               waratta

kakanai
nuganal
hanasanai
katanai
shinanai
kamanai
tsukuranai

warawanal

Since in these forms the consonants preceding u differ, they must be

part of the stem, not the suffix.

Hence, the following rule can be thought of:

er—>[o]/C_.

which reads “r is deleted after a consonant.”

efficient
This chapter lays out phonological rules to describe several allomorphs of
stems and suffixes. The rules are not necessarily system-wide. Some rules are
better restricted to the context of inflection. The distinction however is not
made explicit.

Similarly, the alternation of the suffix ta observed in these forms can
be described by a set of segmental rules.

First, it is obvious that the form da appears after a voiced stop (g, n,
b, m) from the forms nuida, shinda, kanda, and yonda.

“t becomes d after g, n, b, or m.”

Second, tta appears after t, r, and w as in katta, tsukutta, and
waratta.

- t—> tt /{t, r, wh.

Now, there needs to be subsequent rules to alter or delete the stem’s
final consonant.

た and g become 7 before 7 or d, but the syllabicity of 1 depends on the
preceding segment. If it follows e, it is a nucleus, and otherwise, it is
an offglide.

¢ i—>i(nucleus)/e_.

Generally, the order of application matters.

Consonants are deleted before tt.
« C—> [0] /_tt.

m, b, and n become n before 7 or d.

s becomes shi before t. (hanasu—hanashita)
ss一> shi /_t.

Now we turn to nai, which a close examination of the aforementioned
list reveals is underlyingly anai (e.g., tsukuru—tsukuranai). The
allomorph nai appears after a vowel ending stem.

sa一> ol /V .

This may seem trivial, but this rule provides a simple way to reveal
stem-final consonants. In fact, before a is the only environment
where the stem-final w is clearly phonetically and graphically
revealed. In (most) other vocalic contexts, the stem-final w is deleted.

・ W 一> [o] /_Ai, ど, Of.

The case of u admits multiple interpretations. As the original u
corresponds to a syllabic u on the surface, and since w is by definition
a nonsyllabic counterpart of u, it is possible to see the w as the onset
before u. In Kyouro, when a stem-final w is followed by u, it is written
as if the stem-final w remains intact.

waraw              + ‘Oru           ー> wa'ra'wu

The vowel letters e and o of verb suffixes are underlyingly nuclei and,
when w-deletion is applied, their syllabicity remains intact. The
syllabicity of 1 in the same environment depends on the suffix. (These
suffixes will be discussed in the following pages.)

ー> wara'éba

WaraW              +  ()reba

waraW              + you             —> wara''ou

The appearance and disappearance of r are consistent for each stem.
It appears after a vowel and disappears after a consonant. Hence, it
seems safe to say that here we are dealing with the suffixes that are
underlyingly rare and reba, for which no additional rules are

required.

We can see that the segment y appears and disappears
simultaneously with r. Hence, the suffix is yo and we need to modify
our rule accordingly:

Finally, observe the following:

kakanai                       kakimasu                         kaki
kaganai                       kagimasu                         kagi

yobanai                       yobimasu                         yobi
tsukuranai                 tsukurimasu                   tsukuri
warawanali                 waraimasu                      waral
tsukinai                      tsukimasu                       tsuki
tabenai                       tabemasu                         tabe

It is clear that the vowel i appears and disappears in the same way as
a. Hence, we need to modify our rule of a-deletion to include the
deletion of 1.

* ja, iy —> Lo] /V_.
Consequently, the suffixes are imasu and 1.

Implicit in the list is that when 7 follows w as in waraimasu and
warai, the phonetic 7 is a nucleus for the suffix 7 and an offglide for
imasu. This implies that we are observing two different 7s in these
suffixes. We therefore suppose that the 7 in the suffix imasu is
underlyingly an offglide while the 7 in the suffix 7 is underlyingly a
nucleus. This assumption necessitates a further modification of the
vowel deletion rule to capture both types of 1.

¢ {a, i (nucleus), i (offglide)} 一> [o] /V_.
And the w-deletion rule must include the case of the offglide 7.
« w—> [ol /_{i (nucleus), i (offglide), u, e, o}.

And to capture the fact that the offglide 7 turns into a nucleus when
preceded by a consonant, we need the following rule.

¢ i (offglide) 一> i (nucleus) /C_.

The table on the next page summarizes our observations so far. As a
spelling system, Kyouro requires any form to conform to this table
regarding segmental alternations in order for it to be classified as a
verb stem or a verb suffix. If the form in question necessitates
additional phonological rules, it will not be considered a verb. Simply
put, irregular inflections are not inflections.

Where the distinction appears to be critical, the terms token and
tokenized form are used to refer to Kyouro’s unit items and their
represented forms, respectively, as opposed to lexical item and lexical
form, which refer to scientific notions of basic units of linguistic
expressions and their representations. The tenet that forms not
conforming to the phonological rules listed here are not verbs is an
artificial praxis, not a scientific argument. The item iku ‘to go’ is
treated as a token as per our convention, but this does not entail the
claim that it is an indivisible lexical item.

Some miscellaneous facts about the segmental shapes of verb stems:

¢ kaer and たges are the only known “simplexes” with an offglide e in
the entire lexicon of the reference dialect. (Here I avoid discussing
cases of “compounds” like furikaeru (‘to look back’/‘to change (the
date)’), where the suspected diphthong cannot be distinguished
from a hiatus by the distribution of R tone, although for this
particular case it seems reasonable to take the distribution of F tone
as evidence.) The peculiarity of these two stems can be highlighted
by comparing them with aeg (‘to gasp’), a verb stem whose second
last mora is a nucleus e.

The second last mora being an offglide 7 is not rare in the entire
lexicon but is extremely rare for a verb. Some of known instances
are hair (‘to enter’) and hais (‘to abolish’). (aisu ‘to love’ is probably
not a verb form. Author’s note to self: a discussion on this should be
given. )

The second last mora being the second half of a long vowel
(obviously not rare in the entire lexicon) is found in a small number
of verb stems including tos, tor, shos, and kor. Compare them with
moyoos, where the second last mora is a nucleus o which happen to
follow another o.

。・ The potential verbs are mostly predictable but less so than the
imperative form. A vowel verb on one hand typically has its
potential counterpart (‘potential verb’) that theoretically can be
derived by adding raré to the base. A consonant verb on the other
hand typically has its potential counterpart derived by adding e to
it. Besides their imperfect predictability, since this type of
segmental alternation (rare to e) is not allowed in Kyouro, the
potential verbs’ rare and e must be written as part of the stem.

¢« The imperative form of a verb is predictable. It is obtained by
adding ro if it is a vowel-ending verb (“vowel verb”) and e if it is a

consonant-ending verb (“consonant verb”). Since Kyouro does not
allow as a rule the alternation between ro and e (it allows certain
arbitrarily chosen phonological operations but not the ro-to-e
alternation; it is a whitelist system), the imperative form must be
written as a unit form

Adjectives

Every adjective stem ends with a vowel, a, 1, u, o, or marginally o.

Some examples of adjectives are: samu (‘cold’), atsu (‘hot’), sukuna
(‘small in number’), urusa (‘loud’), hiro (‘wide’), sema (narrow ),
kitana (‘dirty’), mabushi (‘bright’).

The noun group

Nouns, temporal nouns, and adjectival nouns are phonological
similar and called the noun group.

The following are some members of the noun group: yama

(‘mountain’), umi (‘ocean’), te (‘hand’), kino (‘yesterday’), kyo
(‘today’), ashita (‘tomorrow’), nihongo (‘Japanese language’).

exorcist
ACCENT

The upper accent

Recall that the AP’s template is nFiFo (Chapter Two). This means
that for any AP it is sufficient to specify its last nF mora to
phonologically characterize it in terms of nF and F.

Consider the following nouns followed by nara (“if it is”). These
nouns do not include an AP boundary (not counting the left edge) in
their underlying form and with nara constitute a single AP.

ke nara                  nF-nF-F

te nara                   nF-F-F

kaki nara                nF-nF-nF-F
yama nara             nF-nF-F-F
haru nara              nF-F-F-F
karada nara           nF-nF-nF-nF-F
onna nara              nF-nF-nF-F-F
tamago nara          nF-nF-F-F-F
remon nara            nF-F-F-F-F

Notice that for all cases the last mora is F. This is because nara is a
two mora item that does not inherently bear nF and for the noun
group any item can bear nF only up to its right segmental edge’s next
mora. For any item in the noun group, if it is N mora long, the longest
nF sequence possible when followed by nara is N + 1 mora long.

As we already know, an AP must begin with an uninterrupted
sequence of nF moras. Since the longest possible nF sequence for the
initial N mora item followed by nara is N + 1 moras long, the number
of possible nF distribution patterns under the same condition is also
N + 1, all of which can be uniquely characterized by specifying the
right edge of the potential nF sequence.

3
InF nF nF nF F
nF nkFnk FF
nF nF F FF
nF F F FE

n=3
n+1=4
In Kyouro, the said specification is indicated by the special symbol '
(modifier letter vertical line) inserted immediately before the final
mora of the potential nF sequence. (This is the first approximation
and will be modified later.) This symbol as well as the specification—
the phonological feature that is supposed in the given position or that
specifies the given position—is called the accent of the form, simplex
or otherwise.

Accordingly, the list is written in Kyouro as the following:

forest
ke nara              nF-nF-F           0
te nara                nF-F-F              1
kak1' nara           nF-nF-nF-F       0
ya ma nara            nF-nF-F-F           1
‘haru nara              nF-F-F-F            2

karada' nara              nF-nF-nF-nF-F 0

onn'na nara           nF-nF-nF-F-F      1

ta'mago nara         nF-nF-F-F-F        2

Temon nara           nF-F-F-F-F          3

The accent number is a number assigned to an AP or relevant form
that is used to refer to the position of the accent. For any given form,
if the accent is at the right segmental edge (i.e., immediately after the
ultimate mora), the accent number is O: if the accent is immediately
behind the rightmost mora, the accent number is 1; if the accent is
right behind the penultimate mora, the accent number is 2; and so on
and so forth. When the given item’s accent number is N, we also say
that the item’s accent is N. In some older documents, accent numbers
are written in parentheses. As of version 5, parenthesizing accent
numbers is optional. In the list above, the accent number indicated in
each line is the one given to the item on the left. For example, the
accent number of ya'ma is 1 because the accent is immediately
before the last mora of the word.

For some groups of lexical items, the position of the accent is more
limited.

The accent number of a verb stem is revealed when it is followed by,
among others, ta. When a verb stem is followed by ta, the following
tonal forms are possible.

kita                              nF-nF                     O        “worn”
nusumimita               nF-nF-nF-nF-F 1

tsukita                         nF-F-F                   っ

“stole a glance at”

“was used up”

The accent number of a verb stem can only be either 0, 1, or 2. 1 is
marginal.

For adjectives, the accent numbers 0, 1, and 2 are possible, but 2 is
available almost exclusively for a two-mora stem, and 1 is mostly
found in three-mora or longer stems. Hence the accent numbers 1
and 2 for adjective stems are in a near complementary distribution.

The accent number of an adjective stem is revealed when it is
followed by, among others, ku.

THE -KU FORM          TONAL MAKE UP THE STEM’S ACCENT #
koku                         nF-F                     1
akaku                        nF-nF-nF             O
aoku                         nF-F-F                 2
yasashiku                 nF-nF-nF-nF  O
kawaiku                    nF-nF-nF-F         1

It seems that the stem of koku is the only one-mora adjective stem.
(As we will see later, yoku and naku are not considered adjective
forms due to ther otherwise irregular inflectional behaviors. )

freezer
Some suffixes have an accent, and therefore one AP can have multiple
accents. This is observed when, among other times, a verb stem takes
the suffix ru, whose accent number is 2 (The nF sequences are
underlined):

uita                 uku

kaita                 kaku
wareta                  wareru
tabeta               taberu
koroshita         korosu
hanashita         hanasu
kurabeta          kuraberu
osameta           osameru
hamideta         hamideru

Take tabeta-taberu. On one hand, the nF sequence of tabeta extends
only through the first mora. This suggests that the stem tabe’s accent
number is 2 and nF is inherently given to the first mora only. On the
other hand, the nF sequence of taberu extends through the second
mora. The nF of be must have been given by the suffix ru, meaning
that the accent number of ru is indeed 2.

As the list exemplifies, for each accent present in the AP, the nF
sequence extends through the accent’s adjacent moras. Between the
stem’s accent and the accent of ru, whichever is placed on the right is
phonetically effective.

In the following example, it is shown that the accent of the suffix
masu, whose accent is 2, is effective with all stems.

uita                   ukimasu
kaita                 kakimasu
wareta              waremasu

tabeta               tabemasu
tabeta               tabemasu
koroshita         koroshimasu
hanashita         hanashimasu
kurabeta          kurabemasu
osameta           osamemasu
hamideta         hamidemasu

In both of these cases, whichever is on the rightmost position is
phonetically effective. Recalling that the accent is supposed
immediately before the final nF mora, however, to generalize our
previous observation, the only necessary rule is:

¢ For each accent within the limits of an AP, the mora immediately
after the accent and all moras behind it receive nF; the remaining
moras receive F.

I suppose this rule feels intuitive for many people under the assumption that
all moras are by default F and nF’s are given by accents.

This rule ensures only the rightmost accent in the given AP is
phonetically effective—given the rightmost accent, all other accents
giving nF are redundant.

When inflection is recursive, an AP can have more than two accents.
Still, the rule is the same. For 'tabé-ha'zimeé-'masu, the rightmost
accent is on masu, and that is the only accent that phonetically
matters.

Correlation on version 5.2.3: the rightmost accent is on masu, not leftmost. I
thank @atri_nen for pointing out the error.

The lower accent

Examine the following, in which nF sequences are underlined:

ke nara                    ke-kara

te nara                     te-kara
kaki nara                 kaki-kara
yama nara                 yama-kara
haru nara                 haru-kara

karada nara             karada-kara

tamago nara            tamago-kara

remon nara                       remon-kara

The ablative suffix -kara extends the nF sequence when the preceding
item’s accent number is 0.

Now, consider the following:

ke nara                    ke-no

te nara                     te-no

kaki nara                 kaki-no
yama nara                 yama-no
haru nara                 haru-no
karada nara             karada-no
tamago nara            tamago-no
remon nara              remon-no

The possessive suffix -no extends the nF sequence when the
preceding item’s accent number is 1 and the preceding item’s accent
is not on the left edge.

It seems that certain items can move the position of the preceding
item’s accent on a selective condition. To determine exactly and

generally when and to where a relevant item moves the preceding
item’s accent, now consider the case of adjectives:

ko-ku                          ko-katta
aka-ku                        aka-katta
ao-ku                           ao-katta
yasashi-ku                 yasashi-katta
sukuna-ku                  sukuna-katta

Now it is observed that the adjective suffix -katta can move the
preceding item’s accent to the left when the accent number is O.

What is common among the cases of -no, -kara, and -katta? It seems
that a suffix can move the preceding item’s accent only if the target
accent is not placed on the AP’s left edge. In the case of -no and
-kara, the AP’s accent moves from the position 2 to the position 1,
and -katta, 3 to 4. It seems that the “goal” of the affected accent is
specified as a property of the suffix causing the move. Observations
such as these allow us to suppose the following generalizations as the
first approximation:

« There exists some position specified for each of these suffixes to
which the preceding form’s accent is moved; and

¢ For the move to occur, the affected accent’s original position must
be within one mora from the specified position and not the left edge
of the AP.

generativist
Our first approximation, however, fails to capture the following fact.
Certain verb suffixes, when attaching to a verb stem whose accent
number is 0, move the stem’s accent to a specific position. This can be
observed below:

tsuketa             tsukerareta

tometa              tomerareta

To capture this, we need to modify the second statement as the
following:

¢ For the move to occur, the affected accent’s original position must
be at the right edge of the base or within one mora from the
specified position and not the left edge of the AP.

Now, our generalization can be restated as the following:

。 Certain items move the immediately preceding form W’s accent A
to the lexically specified position P iff A is not W-initial and is
either W-final or within one mora from P.

In Kyouro, in the tokenized form, P is marked by the special symbol
( ) (modifier letter low vertical line) and is called the lower accent.
The regular accent (' ) may be called the upper accent if necessary, in
which case accent may be used as a hypernym.

When A is moved to P, P is then marked by ' to show that it is
phonetically effective (unless superseded by another accent) and A’s
original position is then marked by , to show the trace. (P and A can
be seen as a pair; when | shifts up, ' shifts down.) Otherwise, accents
are shown in the tokenized form.

Inflection can be recursive. If the resulting form of an inflectional
process undergoes a further inflectional process, the said form acts as
a holistic form. If in inflection the form on the left has multiple upper
accents as a result of the preceding processes, only the rightmost one

is subject to paring. After all processes are done, the placement of the
rightmost upper (not the lower) accent determines the surface
positions of nF and F.

An example of recursive inflection within the verb group (the verbs
and the adjectives) is the following:

。 kappuru ga tagai o mitsumeatta. “A couple contemplated each
other.”

。 futakumi no kappuru ga tagaini tagai o mitsumeawaseta. “A pair
of couples made each other contemplate each other.”

。 futakumi no futakumi no kappuru ga tagaini tagaini tagai o
mitsumeawasesaseta. “A pair of pairs of couples made each other
make each other contemplate each other.”

。 futakumi no futakumi no futakumi no kappuru ga tagaini tagaini
tagaini tagai o mitsumeawasesasesaseta. “A pair of pairs of pairs
of couples made each other make each other make each other
contemplate each other.”

The form mitsumeawasesasesaseta is written in Kyouro as mitume
‘aw:'asé S-'asé s-'asé ta and this is derived through the following
process.

In the derivational process, forms are concatenated working from left
to right. Without accent switching, it may be less obvious why the
order matters. The following example involves accent switching.

The form warawaserareru ‘to be made laugh’ is related to warau ‘to
laugh’ and warawaseru ‘to make (someone) laugh.’ The form
warawaserareru is derived in the following way.

1. waraw +s-asér, 十rarer + ()ru

2. waraw, 十sraser +rarér, + ()ru

3. Wara W・ aser        +rarér, + (Jru
4. Wara Waser        填rarer + ()ru
5. wara,w-asé rarer          + 'Oru
6. waraw-asér'aréru

which can be represented as the following tree:

|                         Wara Ww: asSeT'aTeru                                                  }

Notice how, when accent switching is involved, working from left to
right is necessary to derive the surface form correctly.

The bimoraic rhyme rule

Consider the following:

hachiji nara             hachiji-no            hachiji-kara
kino nara                kino-no              kino-kara

kino indicates that the nF region extends exactly through the first mora of no.

glucose
According to our accent theory, hachiji can be appropriately
characterized and spelled as ha'tizi in Kyouro. How do we spell
kino? Since in the nara context it is nF-nF-F, kn nou can be thought
of, but that would not explain the form kino-no, nF-nF-nF-nF. In
order for no to be nF, the accent of the preceding item, in this case,
kino, needs to be 1 or 0, that is, kino'u or kmnow’. At the same time,
the kara context suggests that it is not 0, since if it was 0, kara would
be nF-nF. This would rule out kinou’'. Now, between kumo u and Ki
‘nou, which is the correct analysis?

To solve the question, observe the following:

koban nara                    O
jodan nara                     っ
nesan nara                    4

All of these words are two syllables and four moras. All syllables are
with a bimoraic rhyme, a rhyme that is two-mora long. Now, notice
that the list does not include words with the accent number 1 or 3. In
a perfect world, the list should look like the following:

koban nara                    O
* ronan nara                   1
jodan nara                     2
* mukin nara                  3
nesan nara                    4

*ronan and *mukin are intended as nonwords.

As implied by the asterisks, a word with the accent number 3 or 1 in
this environment is not realized as-is. In fact, in the entire lexicon, no
known items clearly have a bimoraic rhyme whose second mora is nF
when immediately followed by an F mora.

Let us now turn our attention back to the original question. If kino is
kino 'u, it will not be realized in the nara context as *nF-nF-nF. Such
a form is never possible in any comparable contexts. We can suppose
the following phonological rule while conforming to our observations
of the phonetic forms.

¢« An nF mora on the second half of a two-mora rhyme becomes F if
it is immediately followed by an F mora.

Now we can correctly characterize and write kino as kino'u and this
explains the behaviors of kino and a number of other items, including
ototoi ototo 1 (‘the day before yesterday’), nithon niho'nn (‘Japan’),
nippon nixtupo'nn (‘Japan’), muko muko'u (‘over there’), so so'u
(‘like that; that way'), ko ko'u (‘like this; this way'), takusan takusa
mm(a lot'), daitai danta 1 (‘approximately'), kurai ku ra・1 (‘is
dark’), usui u Su ・1 (‘is thin’), and omoi o'mo '+1 (‘is heavy’).

In isolation, for kino, both nF-nF-F and nF-nF-nF are accepted, but
for nthon, only nF-nF-F is accepted. Perhaps this discrepancy may be
attributed to the segmental makeup, maybe the syntactic standings,
or a combination of them. It is also possible that nihon is not a noun.
With regard to this issue, for now, isolation forms are not used as
evidence for deciding the correct spelling form.

In one other context, the bimoraic rhyme is relevant to tone
allocations. If a boundary fall follows, an nF-nF bimoraic rhyme
becomes nF-F. This is illustrated in the following example:

¢ taimumashinde kino itta. “said yesterday in the time machine.”

¢ taimumashinde kino itta. “went to yesterday by the time machine.”

grammarian
Only in the second example kino is pronounced as nF-nF-F. This is
because in the given environment a boundary fall is otherwise
inserted (a break in the underline aligned to a space indicates a
boundary fall):

。 kurumade yama itta. “went to the mountain by car.”

¢ shinkansende otosanno tokoro itta. “went to dad’s place by bullet
train.”

Observe that these two sentences have a syntactically identical
structure as the last example: [means]-de [destination] itta. “went to
[destination] by [means].” In this structure a boundary fall is found
on the left edge of itta, as long as the preceding mora is nF.

Let us suppose that at some stage of derivation kino is nF-nF-nF in
the time travel sentence as illustrated by the following notation
(notice the asterisk).

。 *taimumashinde kino itta. “went to yesterday by the time
machine.”

A boundary fall is indicated between kino and itta. Comparing this
form with the actual surface form, we can naturally suppose that
another environment where an nF-nF rhyme turns into nF-F is
immediately before a boundary fall.

Hence, we can revise our rule as the following:

。 An nF mora on the second half of a two-mora rhyme turns into F if
it is immediately followed by an F mora or a boundary fall.

After the application of this rule, since a boundary fall never appears
after an F mora, the phonetic boundary fall between kino and itta
needs to be deleted, although, in the Kyouro spelling, the boundary
fall symbols remains there to show the tone of the preceding mora.

A form that has a bimoraic rhyme at the end whose accent number is
1 is said to belong to kino group.

The term kino group (originally “kinorui”) was coined by @xhioe in their
tweet. My 2022 blog post on a relevant topic is available here. I thank @xhioe
for coining the convenient term and promoting the concept.

Accent shift

As we have seen, where the stem and the suffix abut, the latter one of
two adjacent vowels is deleted. An example of this is when the verb
tabe (‘to eat’) takes the suffix i-ha (‘as for doing...’) to form
‘tabé-ha (‘as for eating’). There the vowel 1 of the suffix is deleted.

When the suffix’s vowel that is subject to deletion immediately
follows an accent, lower or upper, the accent moves to one mora left
from its original position: hure + ha 一> hu re・ha

The accent shift takes place after switching paired accents. Hence,
hure + ‘a-‘na1—> huré + ‘a-na'1—> hu re:ma 1

Similarly, when a suffix’s initial consonant undergoes deletion, the
suffix’s accent, upper or lower, is placed according to the suffix’s
accent number and its segmental shape after the consonant deletion.
Take ru, for example. The accent number of ru is 2, which means the
accent intervenes in the stem and is placed one mora left of the
segmental edge of the stem (‘tabé + '(_)r-u 一> ‘ta'bér-u). When it
follows a consonant ending stem, its accent is placed one mora left of
the segmental edge of the stem not counting the stem-final
consonant: waraw' + '(_)r-u —> waraw' + '‘(_)-u —> wa'raw
‘eu (a further spelling rule readjusts the position of accents placed in
the middle of a mora: 一> wa'ra'w-u)

WORD-LEVEL
SYNTAX

BASIC OBSERVATIONS

Syntactic compositionality

A sentence consists of smaller forms. The compositionally of a
sentence is observed in sentences like toshokan ni itta (‘went to the
library’). The former part toshokan ni can be replaced with koen ni
(‘to the park’) to make koen ni itta (‘went to the park’).

Syntactic compositionality is distinguished from phonological
compositionality or that a piece of speech sound is comprised of
smaller units such as segments. Syntactic compositionality is when
smaller forms in a sentence can be identified by the speaker as
coherent linguistic units instead of arbitrary sequences of segments,
syllables, morphemes, words, etc.

Coherency minimally implies that both phonological and semantic
representations are constant. Phonological compositionality and
semantic compositionality must be observed simultaneously. Many
“compounds” fail here. The latter part of tibaggu (‘tea bag’) may be
analyzed to have the same phonological form as baggu (‘handbag’). A
teacher may recklessly attribute them to a single syntactic form, but
adding the form ti to what in isolation means ‘handbag’ to reasonably
derive ‘teabag’ is impossible. They must be treated as unrelated
syntactic entities.

This does not rule out the possibility that they are historically related.

Syntactic boundary

Not all forms are mutually replaceable. The part okina of the sentence
Okina koen (‘the big park’) can be replaced with kireina (‘beautiful’)
to form kireina koen (‘the beautiful park’). But kireina cannot be
used in place of toshokan ni as in toshokan ni itta: *kireina itta.

Only certain forms can stand in a certain spot of a sentence. We need
some means to identify the spot to describe the properties of syntactic
forms. In Kyouro, this is done by labeling the syntactic boundaries. In
this case, the boundary at the left edge of itta is called A4, and the
right edge of kireina and okina R2. Itta cannot follow kireina and
Okina because they do not share the boundary where they abut. The
forms toshokan ni and koen ni can stand before itta because their
right edges are A4.

Okina Ro

a     itta
kireina p, 4

Some of these subparts can be further divided into smaller forms.
Toshokan ni and koen ni have niin common. Toshokan and koen can
replace each other with itself. The left edge of ni and the right edges
of toshokan and koen are the A1 boundary.

hexagon
Composition of forms

The boundary labels are indicated alongside the phonetic form:
。 koen R2|A1

The label on the right side of the symbol ‘|’ (“bar”) indicates the right
boundary. On the left side the left boundary is indicated. In this
example, the phonetic representation is koen, the left boundary is R2,
and the right boundary is A1.

Sometimes the vertical bar is used to represent only one of the two
boundaries. If a form is said to be |X (“bar-X”), it means that the

form’s right boundary is X. A form whose left boundary is X is said to
be X| (“X-bar”).

The other items we have considered so far are the following.
« toshokan R2|A1

。 koen ni ?|A4

。 toshokan ni ?|A4

。 ni Ai|?

。 toshokan ni itta ?|?

。 koen ni itta ?|?

¢ Okina ?|R2

。 kireina ?|R2

Some components are phonetically null and accordingly left implicit.

An unknown boundary is indicated by the symbol ?".

Forms such as koen ni are derived from its subparts. In this case, we
need to characterize koen, ni and a derivational rule that derives koen
ni from them.

The forms koen ni and toshokan ni share the right boundary. The
right boundary (A4) might have been given by the form ni.
Additionally, observe the following:

¢ Okina koen ?|A1
。 koen R2|A1

Despite the difference on the left part (okina is absent in the second
form), they share the right boundary.

These observations suggest that the right boundary of a complex form
is identical to the right boundary of its right subpart. Hence:

。 ni A1IA4

The left boundary of a complex form in some cases seems to be
identical to the left boundary of its right subpart:

« toshokan R2|A1

¢ Okina toshokan R2|A1

。 kireina toshokan R2|A1
But this is not always the case:
。 ni A1IA4

。 toshokan ni .|A4

hijab
The boundary label “.” (called period) indicates that nothing can be
attached to it. Nothing can be the left sibling of toshokan ni. More on
this will be discussed later.

Zero

Consider the following:

¢ toshokan ni itta (‘went to the library’)

¢ toshokan ni nara itta (‘went to the library in particular’)

Toshokan ni and toshokan ni nara seem to share the right boundary.
Does this mean that the form nara has the same A4 boundary on its
left and right edges? If so, the grammar should allow nara to be
added recursively. But that is not the case:

。 *toshokan ni nara nara nara nara itta.

The problem may be solved if we assume a zero in the first example:
。 toshokan ni [o] itta

« toshokan ni nara itta

The phonetic form of a zero is indicated by the symbol ‘[o]’. (Brackets
are given lest it be confused with the accusative o.) Zero is a title
given to any syntactic form corresponding to an empty phonological
form. Simply put, it plays some role in syntax but is not pronounced.

In the new notation, what corresponds to the phonetic form ni, which
we previously described to be ni A1|A4, is described as:

» nifo] A1|A4

This can be further divided into:

。 ni A1i|A2
« [o] A2|A4

Since 77 Ss right boundary is A2, nara’s left boundary should be A2 as
well. Hence:

¢ nara A2|A4

This captures the fact that nara cannot be recursively added after its
duplicate.

Zeros are implicit in the Kyouro spelling.

Naming scheme

We have seen the following boundaries so far: R2, Ai, A2, A3, A4,
period. Other boundary labels used in Kyouro include R1, C1, C2, C3,
C4 (R2c), R2b, P1 (R2d), P2, P3, and P4 (C3b). Inside parentheses are
aliases. The same type of boundary is called P4 or C3b depending on
the context.

Boundaries are named so that zeros can be left implicit. For two
syntactic forms that share the prefix (R, A, C, P, or G) where they
touch each other, if the number (1-5) is greater on the right form, the
two forms can be in effect siblings. For example, toshokan ni R2|A2
can be followed by wa A3|A4 because they share the prefix (A) where
they abut and the number is greater on the right (3 versus 2).

Repeatedly dividing parts into subparts readily means that a form is
represented as a binary tree. The sentence toshokan ni nara itta is

represented as the following:

In this example, branching consistently takes place on the left node. If
a sentence structure is always left-branching, it would be practically a
flat structure. (The branching direction would not matter.) In reality,
branching directions can be mixed:

Different branching directions correspond to different meanings. The
following examples show that the phonetic form kino katta donatsu o

tabeta can mean “(I) ate a donut that (I) yesterday bought” or
“yesterday (I) ate a donut that (I) bought” depending on the
branching direction.

Different branching directions can be reflected differently in the
phonetic form. Syntax-phonology mapping will be discussed in

Merging

Merging is branching seen from below. When a phrase AB branches
into A and B, it is said that A and B merge, A merges with B, or A and
B are merged. Formation of a sentence is expressed in terms of what
subforms merge with what in which order. The phrase ABC can be
built by merging A and BC, which has been formed from B and C
merging, or by merging AB, which has formed from A and B merging,
and C. The phrase ABC can merge with another phrase to form a
greater form which then can merge again. The process repeats until
the sentence completes.

Syntactic forms are expressed in the following format:
¢ to Pi\A2

¢ hayaku A4/A2

。 sugoku ./A4

On the left is the phonetic form. On the right is the form’s syntactic
boundaries: the left boundary on the left and the right boundary on
the right. The slash in the middle indicates the merging direction: ‘/’
indicates that the form merges rightward and ‘\’ leftward. The symbol
‘|’ is used to indicate boundaries without specifying the merging
direction. The slashes and the vertical bar can be used to indicate a
boundary for only one side of it. The notation will be extended as we
proceed with our analysis.

General principles of merging

The right boundary principle: On a leftward merge, the right
boundary is inherited to the resulting form. Taken literally, this is a
blank statement (unless a major boundary is involved; see below)
because the right boundary does not matter when it merges leftward.

We say that a leftward-merging form has a boundary X on its right to
indicate that the resulting phrase will have X on its right.

2 form y
A form BRB xX form Y

The left boundary principle: If a form has R2 or A4 (the major
boundaries) on its left and merges leftward, the resulting form will
have the same major boundary on its left. This is contrasted with the
case of the minor boundaries (any boundary that is not major is
minor), where the resulting form will have period on its left. (Later
we will see that this can be overwritten in several instances.)

R2 form XX
A tormR Ro 1orm y

The direction principle: If the form has a major boundary on the
left side of a rightward slash, the form is bidirectional; it can merge
rightward or leftward. (By convention, we do not place period on the
right side of a rightward slash as the symbols’ meanings would
contradict.) Forms that do not meet this criteria are unidirectional.
We use a leftward slash when the item’s left boundary is major and
the item is leftward unidirectional.

。 hayaku A4/A2

If neither side of a slash is period, the form is usually leftward-merging and
the right boundary is indicated to satisfy the right boundary principle. The
direction principle can be understood as a statement of an exception of this
generality—that if the left side of a rightward slash is major the form is
allowed to merge in the opposite direction.

Boundary generation                                       Where two slashes are used for one form, the leftmost boundary
indicates the form’s left boundary, and the two boundaries indicated

Observe the following:                                                                                on the right are for the left and right boundaries of the resulting form.
Here it is stated that the suffix kereba generates A4/A4 and sa
¢ samukereba A4/A4                                    generates R2/m-ii when merging. These item-specific properties

ー                                                                                                       supersede the left boundary principle.
。 samusa R2/m-1

These forms seem to share the stem:
。 samu ./k-ii

Therefore the suffixes must be:

¢ kereba k-i\A4

¢ sa k-i\m-ii

But according to the left boundary principle, merging these suffixes
with the stem should generate:

。 *samukereba ./A4

。 *samusa ./m-ii

which are wrong as demonstrated by:
。 sonnani samukereba

。 huyuno samusa

How should we solve this? The left boundary of the resulting form is
ascribed to the relevant lexical items as their properties:

¢ kereba k-i\A4/A4

。 sa k-i\R2/m-ii

Branch notation

Recall that the sentence kawati Okina toshokan ni nara itta has the
following syntactic structure:

¢ ((((kawaii (okina toshokan)) ni) nara) itta)

If the same structure is visually expressed, it will look like the
following:

と                                                                                                                                _
kawaii okina toshokan ni nara itta

kawaii okina toshokan ni nara
kawaii Okina toshokan ni
kawaii okina toshokan

okina toshokan

kawaii               okina           toshokan ni       nara             itta
\_                                                                                                                             _ノ

A two-dimensional diagram like this is intuitive but space-
consuming. To aid visual parsing while keeping everything in one
line, what is called branch notation is employed:

¢ kawaii/ okina/ toshokan\\/ ni\/ nara\/ itta\
This equals to the following form in the reverse Polish notation:
¢ kawaii okina toshokan\\ ni\ nara\ itta\

Branch notation is simply reverse Polish notation with redundant
slashes added to represent left branches for easier eye parsing. (It is
called branch notation because you can see the slashes as branches
squeezed into one line).

This notation was originally described in a blog post of mine. The original
version allowed multiple distribution patterns of slashes for the same
structure. The idea was to utilize the redundancy to reflect additional analyses
or intuitions about the sentence, such as headedness. In this version, the
notation is more restricted, so that the positions of slashes are uniquely
determined. I thank @hedalu244 for discussing formalism of this notation
back in 2019.

WORD BOUNDARIES

Quotation (P1, P4, P5)

At least three types of quotation must be recognized. The first type
(type-I quotation) introduces a fact or idea into a larger sentence.
This can be considered a type of indirect quotation. It semantically
resembles the English that clause that introduces a fact or idea into a
larger sentence. In the following, since it is an indirect quotation,
ashita refers to the day after the time of the utterance.

。 ashitamadeni sutsu O kurtninguni daseba, kekkonshikini wa
maniau to omotta. “thought that if I brought my suit to the cleaners
tomorrow, it would be ready in time for the wedding.”

The second type of quotation (type-II quotation) embeds the entirety
of the target sentence (or “near sentence"一a discussion on this
follows) nearly word-to-word into the larger sentence.

。 “demo sonna koto shitara maichan kaette korenai jan” tte kato ga
iu kara, orora o mini iku no wa kekkyoku akirameta. “Because
Kato said, ‘but if we do such a thing Mai won’t be able to come
back,’ ultimately we gave up going to see auroras.”

。 “isshoni momijigari ni ikimasenka” nante twarete, aitsu ga
kotowaru wake nai desho. “If you ask him, ‘Would you go to see the
autumn leaves with me?’ there’s no way he will turn you down.”

The third type (type-III) deals with potentially paralinguistic
expressions. The quoted portion can violate the usual phonology of
Japanese. This is illustrated by the following example.

¢ jimu wa watashini “Til take you to New York’ to itta.

(Fujita 1994, p. 75.)

The quoted part “I'll take you to New York” can be pronounced like
English. Phonetic katakanization is not obligatory.

Inconveniently the phonetic forms of the quoting particles used in
these different types of quotations partially overlap: tte, to, nante,
and so on. But they are syntactically distinct.

Immunity
The items used to make a type-II quotation are labeled as P4|.

Since these items merge leftward, the backslash symbol is used in
place of the bar.

- to P4\A2
。 tte P4\A4
« nante P4\A4

Similarly, type-III quoting particles can be characterized as the
following:

« to P5\A2

« tte P5\A4

。 nante P5\A4

And type-I quoting particles:
« to Pi\A2

« tte Pi\A4

。 nante P1\A4

The type-III quotation is where we find the outermost layer of the
structure of an utterance. The type-II deals with a unit clearly smaller
than the utterance and nearly equal to but seemingly slightly smaller
than the sentence.

Iori (2012), citing Minami (1974, 1993), treats the target of a direct
quotation, called the D-rui or “type D” (per Iori 2017), as virtually
identical to a sentence (p. 176, pp. 199-204). A motivation to make a

distinction between the sentence and type D and a distinction
between type-III and type-II can be illustrated by the following
examples:

。 “kotarosan kin‘yobino yoru aitemasuka?” tte miyazawasan ga
ittemashita yo.

« “a, kotarosan kin’yobino yoru aitemasuka?” tte miyazawasan ga
ittemashita yo.

On one hand, the former can be a case of a type-II or type-III
quotation. In a real-life speech, if it is a type-III quotation, the quoted
portion can be pronounced with a different tone of voice from the rest
of the utterance for the effect of imitating the supposed original
speaker. If it is a type-II quotation, ignoring uncontrolled
performance factors一stutter, hesitation, etc一the tone of speech will
be consistent throughout the utterance. On the other hand, the latter
is clearly a case of a type-II] quotation due to the presence of the filler
a. In a real-life speech it is likely, though not obligatory, that a
different tone of voice is used to show that it is a type-III quotation.
Certain “less meaningful” items seem to be unavailable for type-II
quotation, and a used here seems to be one of them.

Another item incompatible with type-II is tteba.
。 “kin’yobi wa itsumo tsogashii n da tteba” to miyazawa ga itta.

This is inevitably a case of a type-III quotation due to the presence of
tteba. For this nature, the boundary between tteba and to can be seen
aS an approximation of the right boundary of a sentence. The
sentence can then be approximated as any syntactic unit that is .|P5.

Some more work needs to be done to pinpoint the layperson’s notion of a

sentence. Being .|P5 alone is not enough to exclude an utterance of multiple
sentences and a type-III-quoted portion of a larger sentence.

itinerary
In novels and other forms of literary works, a type-III quoting particle
is often phonetically null (zero). Observe that in the following
example the quotation cannot be a type-II quotation.

。 “kotarosan kinyobino yoru aitemasuka?” miyazaki ga itta.

Predicate (P1, P2, P3)

To see the difference between P1, P2, and P3, observe the following:

mochiron kekkon wa shitai yo

mochiron nishukande kekkon nante muri daro yo

mochiron kekkon wa shitai kedo

*mochiron nishukande kekkon nante muri daro kedo

Daro kedo is not allowed. Compare the phonetic form of muri daro in
the second example with the intended correct form corresponding to
the fourth example. Unlike the second, in the fourth one the first two
moras of daro are pronounced in nF. The two instances of phonetic
daro are not identical. It is therefore necessary to see the latter as not
the same item but as part of another lexical entry whose phonetic
form is darokedo.

muri daro yo        nF-F-F-F-F-F
* muri daro kedo nF-F-F-F-F-F-F
muri darokedo nF-F-nF-nF-F-F-F

The fact that kedo is not allowed after daro demonstrates the
distinction between P3 and P2. Kedo cannot appear after daro
because:

。 kedo P2\A4

。 daro C4\A4/P3

Daro needs to generate A4| because it can follow |C3 to constitute a
predicate that receives A4 modifications as shown in the second
example.

Unlike kedo, as illustrated in the examples, yo can follow daro:
・り0 P3\P5

In the same syntactic category as yo are:

。 tteba P3\P5

。 ne P3\P5

(Correction in version 5.0.4): *sa P3\P5 —> sa C2\P5. (Cf. *desu sa). Also
darosa C4\A4/P5 is necessary. I thank @wyoreorm for pointing this out.

To account for darokedo we need:

。 darokedo C4\A4/A4

ivermectin
Some other items distributed similarly are:
¢ darokara C4\A4/A4
。 deshokedo C4\A4/A4

。 deshokara C4\A4/A4

The difference between P2 and P1 can be found in a similar fashion.
Consider the following:

¢ daigakusei ni natta karaniwa
。 *daigakusei ni narimashita karaniwa
¢ daigakusei ni natta kara desu
¢ *daigakusei ni narimashita kara desu

¢ daigakusei ni natta kara, arubaito o shitemiru no mo ti kato
omotte

。 daigakusei ni narimashita kara, arubaito o shitemiru no mo ti
kato omoimashite

Karaniwa cannot follow narimashita while it can follow natta.
(Readers who feel otherwise may be thinking of some special registers
that a tour attendant might use.) This is captured by stating:

« natta |P1
。 narimashita |P2
。 karaniwa P1\A4

A bit more tricky is the case of kara and kara desu. Taking kara
alone, it appears that both natta and narimashita can precede it. But

only when kara follows natta, desu can appear after kara. To see
what conditions the distribution of desu, notice that in the example
“daigakusei ni narimashita ...” of this page narimashita kara is
followed by another clause. The following examples may make the
point easier to see:

。 akarichan wa isogashii kara asobenai.
。 jojikun wa ashi ga hayai kara moteru.

When followed by another clause, kara is |A4, and when followed by
desu, it is |C2. They are different items:

。 kara Pi\C2
。 kara P2\A4

Kara P1i\C2 cannot follow narimashita A4|P2 and kara P2\A4 can
follow it as indicated by the boundary labels.

Some similar items are:
- ga P2\A4

。 kedo P2\A4

¢ shi P2\A4

。 keredomo P2\A4

。 kedomo P2\A4

Around relative clauses (R1, R2, R2b, R2c, R2d)

vice versa. »humanity

Study the distribution of noni and kara in the following examples:
。 daigakusei ni natta noni arubaito mo dekinai

¢ daigakusei ni natta kara arubaito ga dekiru

。 daigakusei na noni arubaito mo dekinai

。 *daigakusei na kara arubaito ga dekiru

。 *daigakusei da noni arubaito mo dekinai

。 daigakusei da kara arubaito ga dekiru

Both noni and kara can appear after natta but only noni can appear
after na and only kara can appear after da. This is because their left
boundaries differ:

。 noni R2b\A4
。 kara R2d\A4
and

¢ da |Red

¢ na |R2b
¢natta A4/R1

As per our naming scheme, for the right boundary of a form to be
compatible with both R2b| and Rg2c|, it has to be named R1.

Accordingly, natta is |R1. In the previous subsection we have seen
that natta is |P1, but that is because P1 is another name of Red, and
(again, as per our naming scheme) a |R1 form can behave as |R2d
without changing its corresponding phonetic form.

The following are some other examples of items that are R2b].

node R2b\A4

noka R2b\A4

n R2b\C3

no R2b\C3

The other boundaries that can follow R1 are, besides R1 itself, R2 and
R2c. R2c is observed in sentences such as:

¢ asatte tenjikai iku nara, watashi mo tsuretette yo

。 datte, hontoni jugyo ga kyuko ni natta nara, isogashiku nai desho
where

。 ku A4/R1

。 natta A4\R1

¢ nara R2c\A4

jakarta
Since R2c is an alias of C4, nara R2c\A4 can follow C1, C2, and C3:

。 misakichan no koto nara watashi ga yattoku kara, mo agatte
dayobu da yo

。 hitori de wa muri demo, sannin nara dekiru

。 moshi yamadasan ga maketa no ga aite ga miyamotosan datta
kara nara, miyamotosan wa yamadasan yori tsuyoi koto ni naru

。 shutcho ni iku n nara sono maeni katazuke owarasete
where

¢ koto |C2

。 sannin |C1

。 kara |C2

・ 7 1C3

R2 is, informally speaking, the left edge of a typical noun. Also, the
genitive no’s right edge is R2, which is why the genitive no can be
followed by a noun. The following examples demonstrate these facts:

。 satokunno apato

。 misakichanno obento
where

。 satokunno ./R2

。 misakichanno ./R2

« apato R2/C2

。 obento R2/C2
The difference between R2 and R1 can be observed with:
¢ ka R1\A1 ‘whether’

(Cf. *kireina ka ‘whether it is beautiful’; kawaii ka ‘whether it is cute’;
kireina is |R2.)

ka is one of the few items that is |Ai that is not an inflectional suffix. The
existence of this item, among others, justifies the A1 boundary as a word-
level, as opposed to inflectional level, boundary. »journalist

On a related note, the past form of the copula datta ‘was’ is C3\R1
while the present da ‘is’ is C3\P1. Hence:

。 hito R2\C2

。 suki A4\C2

¢ suki datta hito ‘the person (I) liked’

¢ *suki da hito ‘the person (1) like’

Around copulas (C1, C2, C2b, C3, C3b, C4)
»pun

Using a copula is one of the strategies to constitute a predicate from a
noun and other items that are |C2 or |C3. Copulas include:

japanologist
・ da C3\A4/P1 ‘is’

¢ datta C3\A4/R1 ‘was’

¢ desu C3\A4/P2 ‘is’

¢ deshita C3\A4/P2 ‘was’

。 desuka C3\A4/P4 ‘is ... ?’

。 deshitaka C3\A4/P4 ‘was ... ?’
・ na C2\A4/R2b

¢ ka C2\A4/P5 ‘oh’

Some of them are C3|. These forms can follow n (‘because’), which is
R2b\C3. Items that are C2| cannot follow n. This justifies the
distinction between C2 and C3.

Correction in version 5.1.2: “Some of them are C3|” not |C3. I thank
@ho_hasios for pointing this out.

doko ni tku 7 desuka? ‘Where are (you) going? Lit. Because going

*aitai hito ga irunnannan... ‘because it’s because it’s because ...
I want to see someone’

*kaimono ni iku n ka ‘oh, because (You re) going shopping?’

Items that have C2 or C1 on the right, such as kara Pi\C2 ‘because’
and futari R2/C1 ‘two people’, can be followed by C3.

¢ futari datta kara desuka? ‘Because it was two people?’

C1 is characterized by no Ci\R2 “(amount/quantity) of (as in “two of
the apples”). It is important not to confuse this with the possessive
no.

。 futatsu no ringo ‘two pieces of the apples’

。 hitori no gakusei ‘one person of the students’

Some other notable words that have C1 on the left are:

。 nisen’en wa moratta ‘received at least two thousand yen’

。 nisen’en mo tsukatta ‘spent as much as twenty thousand yen’

C2b, C3b, and C4 are the aliases of A4, P4, and R2c, respectively. This
means C1 can freely precede an A4 boundary:

・ gakusel ga sannin aruiteiru ‘three students are walking. lit.
students are walking in a group of three’

And C1 and C2 can be followed by P4 (relevant places unitalicized):

。 watashino kaono shiwa ga suki tte kare wa itta. “He said he liked
the wrinkles of my face.”

。 tsugini kuru no wa nihonkabu tte senpai ga itteta yo. “Our senior
said Japanese stocks are booming next.”

« daro C4\A4/P3 ‘I suppose’

ame wa ashitaniwa yamu daro. “I suppose the rain will stop by

kinyobi wa isogashii to itta janaika. “I told you I’m busy on

。 sonnani nihon ni ikitai nara hitoride itte. “If you want to go to
Japan so bad go by yourself.”

Arguments and adverbial phrases (A1, A2, A3,
A4)

Recalling the version 2 terminology, A1 is roughly “nominal” and A4
“adverbial.” These two boundaries are characterized by, among
others, the following items:

・ ga A1\A4 (nominative)

¢ 0 A1\A4 (accusative)

A4 is typically found as the left boundary of the predicate:
¢ basu ga kita. “The bus arrived.”

。 fujisan o mita. “saw Mt. Fuji.”

Other items that are |A4 include wa and mo, but their left boundaries
are not A1 as demonstrated by the following examples.

e Satosanni wa maketaku nai 7 desu. “Because I don’t want to be
defeated by Sato specifically.”

。 Kyoto dakede naku, tokyode mo sakura o miru koto ga dekiru.
“Not only in Kyoto, but in Tokyo too cherry blossoms can be seen.”

。 Hikkishiken ga dame de mo mada mensetsude bankai suru chansu
ga aru. “Even if you messed up the paper test, you still have a
chance to recover on the interview.”

jigsaw
。 Hikkishiken ga kore de wa ikura mensetsu ga yokutemo goukaku
wa dekinai. “If the paper test is this (bad), there's no chance of
passing no matter how you do well on the interview.”

In the examples above, satosanni (‘by Sato’) and tokyode (‘in Tokyo’)
are |A2, and de (‘given that ... is’) is |A3. Wa and mo can connect to
these boundaries (A2 and A3) because they are A3|. Another example
of an item that has A3 on its left is koso:

e Satosanni koso maketaku nai n desu. “Because I don’t want to be
defeated, precisely by Sato.”

。 Kyoto dakede naku, tokyode koso sakura o miru koto ga dekiru.
“Not only in Kyoto, but precisely in Tokyo cherry blossoms can be
seen.” (This is semantically awkward, albeit not ungrammatical.)

¢ Hikkishiken ga dame de koso mada mensetsude bankai suru
chansu ga aru. “Precisely because you’ve messed up the paper test,
you still have a chance to recover on the interview.” (Again, this is
grammatical.)

The difference between |A2 and |A3 is manifested by the distribution
of nara A2\A4 ‘if it is’.

e Satosanni nara maketaku nai n desu. “Because I don’t want to be
defeated if it is by Sato.”

。 Kyoto dakede naku, tokyode nara sakura o miru koto ga dekiru.
“Not only in Kyoto, but if it is in Tokyo cherry blossoms can be
seen.” (This is semantically awkward, albeit not ungrammatical.)

« *Hikkishiken ga dame de nara mada mensetsude bankai suru
chansu ga aru. Intended: *“Given that if it is you’ve messed up the
paper test, you still have a chance to recover on the interview.”

Nara A2\A4 can follow satosanni and tokyode because they are |A2,
but not de because it is |A3.

To summarize:

ga A1\A4 (nominative)

o A1\A4 (accusative)

wa A3\A4 ‘specifically’

mo A3\A4 ‘even’

koso A3\A4 ‘precisely’

nara A2\A4 ‘if it is’

¢ de C2\A4/A3 ‘given that ... is’ (literary)
Some other items that have A1, A2, A3, or A4 are:

The ontology of G1, G2, and C1

Finishing Chapter Five is recommended before reading this subsection.

G1 and G2 are closely related to both what has been informally called
the verbal nouns and the verbs (d-i, d-ii, d-iii, d-iv, d-v, and d-vi). They
are newly recognized boundaries and they or their equivalents used to
be misidentified as C1. After some close examinations of phenomena
around Ci and suru, it was evident that some separate boundaries,
now named G1 and G2, were necessary.

To repeat, Ci is a boundary found at, among other places, the right
edge of some quantifiers such as minna and futari (»jeans). |C1 can
be followed by de C1\A4, among others, as in:

¢« kono mafura wa futari de amimashita. “The two people (=we)
together knitted this scarf.”

。 minna de gojira o yattsukemashita. “Everyone (=we) together beat
Godzilla.”

Since quantifiers are phonologically similar to nouns, and since the function
of the phonetic no that follows them is at least superficially similar to the
noun suffix no, it is easy to mistakingly mix them up. A clear case that
demonstrates that C1 is not a noun boundary is the following. It differs from
the noun possessive suffix in the phonetic form:

otoko                          otokono

minna                       minna no

In another usage, no C1| is placed after a fait accompli, followed
immediately by a statement made based on it.

。 sonna fukuzatsuna kin’yushohin ga dekita no mo, sore ga
toripuruent kakuzuke sareta no mo, chantoshita gakujutsutekina
rironno konkyo ga atte no koto yo.

(マチネの終わりに.)

which is parsed as:

r                                                        Ro                                                                          ~
./R2
A4/C1
/A4
./A1                      A1\A4           A4/C1            Ci\R2            R2|
|… konkyo    ga        atte       no        koto         J

For both quantitative and fait accompli cases, |C1 freely connects to
A4|. For this reason, C2b is an alias of A4.

« pokemon o nihiki tsukamaeta.
。 huryo ga sannin aruitekita.

。 sakamotosan ga oenni haittekurete, yatto donika shigoto ga
mawaru yoni natta.

journey
We have seen that |C1 can be made with a verb form. It can also be
made with a copula or an adjective.

« katte mo ii to wa itta kedo, sore wa jubun {yasukattara/anka
dattara} no hanashi da yo.

where

。 yasukattara A4/C1
¢ anka ./km-ii

¢ dattara C3\A4/C1

Caution must be exercised not to confuse the fait accompli/quantifier
de C1\A4 with the copular de C2\A4/A3 as in:

。 jorenkyaku ga tatta futari de wa, totemo eigyo o tsuzukerarenai.
“Tf the regulars are only two people, the business cannot possibly be

carried on.” (de C2\A4/A3)

。 shojikin ga sen’en de mo nomeru mise wa aru. “Even if what you
have is a thousand yen, you can drink at some of the places.” (de

C2\A4/A3)

When the subject of the clause of the copular de C2\A4/A3 is
phonetically absent, the phonetic distinction can be lost:

。 (shojikin ga) sen’en de mo nomeru mise wa aru. (de C2\A4/A3)

。 sen’en de mo nomeru mise wa aru. “even with a thousand yen, you
can drink at some of the places.” (de C1\A4)

It is not intended to claim that the “omission” is a phonetic-level process.

It seems reasonable to recognize at least two semantic usages of de
C1\A4, the fait accompli usage and the quantitative, conditioned by
the syntactic or semantic environment.

Although they are called “usages” here, they are likely separate lexical items.

。 sourukara tokyoe wa sanjikan de ikeru. (quantitative)

。 sono hanashi suru no, basude de ti? (fait accompli)

The quantitative usage must be distinguished from the instrumental de form
of a noun. Assuming that the instrumental de in question is C1| requires a
zero suffix in the noun paradigm that makes |C1, which, since C2b is an alias
of A4, results in a phonetically bare noun being followed by an A4| item. The
problem of this consequence is that A4 when following a phonetic bare noun
accompanies a boundary fall but when following C1 it does not.

。 atama butsuketa.

In the example above, a boundary fall is inserted between atama and
butsuketa. Compare this with the following quantitative example:

¢ hayaku shinaito minna itchau yo.
where no boundary falls are found.
Hence, the said instrumental de is not C1 |.

In addition, the fact that no following a noun conforms with the phonological
rule of - no is compatible with this conclusion. »journey

Other notable usages of C1 are noted in the noun and the temporal noun
sections. »procrastinator, »reality

Let us now turn to the issues of G1 and G2. G2 is a boundary found,
among other places, between suru (and its related items) and an
immediately preceding certain verb suffixes including twa, imo, isae,
and so on. In version 4, today’s G2 was equated with C1 without much
of a good reason. If anything, G2 at least feels adverb-ish. A native
speaker of Japanese can probably see this in the following example:

journeyman
。 kodomo futario daigaku ni ikaseru tameni jitaku o urisae shita.
(»snapshot for why futario not futari o.)

But this shita does not appear immediately after a |C1 quantifier.
s shakkin o minna de hensai shita.
。 *shakkin o hensai minna shita.

The same shita appears after what can be called verbal nouns, those
that are phonologically noun-like and semantically verb-like. Hensai
in the examples above is one of them.

e suwabeno choshu o tanto shita hikara tokahodo tatta aruhi, okino
wa futatabi, mogamino shitsumushitsuni yobareta.

(検察側の罪人.)

。 karera wa minzokufunsono heitwatekikaiketsusaku o miidasoto
kenmeini doryoku shita.

CBE A mie Ame.)

In the examples above, tanto and doryoku are what we call verbal
nouns. Usual adverbs do not intervene between these and shita, but
sae, mo, and wa (and some others) can intervene.

yoku tanto shita.

*tanto yoku shita.

tanto sae shita.

chokikan doryoku shita.

*doryoku chokikan shita.

¢ doryoku wa shita.

This is analogous to the cases where zeros can be replaced with non-
zero items without changing the right boundary of the phrase.
(»humanity.) Hence, the same strategy—set multiple boundaries
whose gap can be filled with zeros—can be employed and G1 and G2
are separately postulated. Accordingly,

。 wa G1\G2
。 mo G1\G2
。 sae G1\G2
。 shita G2|R1

Some may find it necessary to admit an additional suffix o to account for
when an instance of the accusative particle o appears in one place for the
semantic object of the verbal noun and another appears between the verbal
noun itself and the following suru (su'ru) or a related item. Such a
construction is usually considered ungrammatical (Masuoka & Takubo 1992,
p. 20), but it has been claimed that in real-life speeches they are repeatedly
found (Kurosawa 2008). The situation will be properly described if we
assume in those who accept the said construction’s lexicon some forms that
semantically are verbal noun-like, phonetically have o at the end, and
syntactically are G2 on its right. That is:

¢ onegaio |G2
。 kenkyuo |G2

The exact syntactic nature of shita still needs to be investigated in
some more detail to be determined. Before doing so, some
investigation on G1 would be worthwhile.

First, recognize that deki and shita shows some distributional
similarity:

joviality
s konankun wa kuruma o unten dekita.
s konankun wa kuruma o unten shita.

Their difference however becomes apparent when a GilG2 item
intervenes:

s *konankun wa kuruma o unten mo dekita.
e konankun wa kuruma o unten mo shita.
This suggests that deki is ば1| .

Now, notice that replacing o with no makes the first example well-
formed:

s konankun wa kurumano unten mo dekita.
s konankun wa kurumano unten mo shita.

The fact that unten is preceded by kurumano suggests that unten
there is somehow R2|.

Simply stating that unten can be R2| does not explain the unacceptability of
the following:

。 *konankun wa kuruma o jozuna unten mo shita.

as opposed to:

。 konankun wa kuruma o jozuni unten mo shita.

Compare:

。 konankun wa kurumano jozuna unten mo dekita.

。 konankun wa kurumano jozuna unten mo shita.

Suppose now that jozuna unten mo shita (this is wellformed if uttered in
isolation) is somehow R2| so that kuruma o .|A4 cannot precede it. This
presupposition is immediately falsified by:

。 nandomo jozuna unten mo shita.
。 konankun wa jozuna unten mo shita.

It seems that our boundary-labeling approach cannot efficiently handle the
situation. This seems to be one of the cases where we need to approach
acceptability from the point of view of semantics. More on this will be
discussed in p. surname.

Recall that phonetically identical mo, sae, wa are available along the
A series boundaries, as in:

。 konankun wa kuruma mo motte iru.
。 konankun wa kuruma sae motte tru.
。 konankun wa kuruma wa motte iru.
where

* mo A3\A4

。 sae A2\A4

・ wa A3\A4

We can then suppose that the phonetic mo dekita is allowed after |A3
but not after |G1. In fact, it is not difficult to observe that unten when
preceded by |R2 behaves as a noun (|m-ii), which is shown partly by:

。 konankun wa kurumano untenkara sesunano sojumade dekita.
。 kurumano untenno jozuna konankun.

where untenkara is pronounced exactly like untenn -ka'ra. Of
course, kara is not allowed when unten is preceded by o:

¢ *konankun wa kuruma o untenkara sesuna o sojumade dekita.

jowly
Putting our observations so far together, it seems that the lexicon has
a zero that turns a |G1 item into a noun (R2/m-i, to be more
specific):

。 [O| G1\R2/m-ii

and that typical |G1 items such as unten and soju are lexically ./G1
since they do not allow a preceding |R2 unless they are turned into a
noun:

。 unten ./G1

。 soju ./G1

That they are not A4/G1 is suggested by:

。 *konankun wa kurumano jozuni unten shita.
。 *konankun wa sesunano sukoshi soju dekita.

The remaining questions are as to how deki and shita are lexically
characterized. We have already seen that deki is G1| and shita is G2].
One of the questions is how they can follow |A4. Since unten and soju

are ./G1, deki and shita must generate A4| as a result of merging.
That is:

¢ shita G2\A4/R1

The necessity of deki being G1\A4/d-i is not obvious since as long as it
is a verb (|d-i) it has a chance to obtain A4| through a merge with an
inflectional suffix. For now, I suggest the following:

。 deki G1\d-i

Note that it cannot be rightward merging since merging breaks the G1
boundary.

Finally, let us confirm that a verbal noun merges rightward before it
merges with an o-phrase in sentences such as konankun wa kuruma
o unten shinakatta.

Konankun wa kurumao_ unten         shinakatta.
* Konankun wa kurumao unten         Shinakatta.
* Konankun wa kurumao Unten        shinakatta.
* Konankun wa kurumao Unten        Shinakatta.
Konankun wa Kurumao unten         shinakatta.
* Konankun wa Kurumao unten         Shinakatta.
Konankun wa Kurumao Unten        shinakatta.
Konankun wa Kurumao Unten        Shinakatta.

This confirms our assumption as from this observation the triangle
constraint suggests the following structure:

shinakatta\\\              |

Our analysis now allows us to visually express how verbal nouns work
in a sentence:

| konankun wa/       kuruma o/ unten/

| A4/Ru
A4/R1
A4/R1
./A4           ./A4        ./G1        G2\A4/R1

Chapter Five

INFLECTION
PRELIMINARY REMARKS ON
INFLECTION

On the (non)nature of the inflectional boundaries

By dividing a sentence in the way we have seen in the previous
chapter, the analysis eventually reaches a lexical form, a syntactic
form that is indivisible without breaking the syntactic coherency.

Some of these lexical forms fall into the classes of the traditional parts
of speech, such as adjectives, verbs, and, nouns. As part of the effort
of organizing and presenting the grammatical description in a way
that is comfortable for myself and for those who are familiar with the
traditional grammatical terminology, select boundaries are classed
into inflection groups and are given familiar names: the verb
boundaries, the adjective boundaries, the noun boundaries, the
adjectival noun (roughly corresponds to ketyodoshi) boundaries, etc.

Deciding which boundaries are word-level and which are inflectional
was necessary also for the sake of spelling aesthetics. Nobody would
want to put a space at every syntactic boundary. This pertains to the
parseability principle; with dozens of grammatical boundary types,
having some means to distinguish certain groups of them from the
rest seems useful.

The distinction between the word-level and the inflectional
boundaries is arbitrary and has no real significance in the grammar.
It is a matter of presentation. Select hand-picked boundaries are

called inflectional so that the terminology feels friendly and is
convenient for designing spelling rules. All else are word-level.

WHICH BOUNDARIES ARE INFLECTIONAL?

This subsection is written in a new style.

As a native speaker of Japanese, I feel that certain boundaries were more
“inflection-ish” than the others. The boundary found on the left side of the adjective
ending i, found in such forms as samui and yasashii, is one of the inflection-ish

boundaries. I believe most Japanese speakers feel the same.

The following are some items whose left side is one of the more “inflection-ish”

boundaries:

・ ku as in yasashiku and samuku
- te asin tabete and aruite

・ ruas in taberu and tsumeru

- sO as in kireiso and taihenso

What are common among (some of) the inflection-ish boundaries? What

contributes to the naive impression that they are inflection-ish?

Syntactically, these boundaries tend to be more “internal” than some of the less
inflection-ish boundaries. We will later see that there is reason to believe the middle
item yasashi as in sugoku yasashii merges rightward (yasashi + é) first and then the
resulting phrase merges leftward (sugoku + yasashii). The left boundary of é is more

internal than the left boundary of yasashi.

Phonologically, the inflectional boundaries are seldom aligned to an AP boundary.
None of the items listed above as “inflection-ish” are disallowed to follow another
item within the same AP as demonstrated by yasashiku wa, tabete no, taberu kara,
and taihenso da. This amounts to saying that they tend to be phonologically more

internal than some other boundaries.

- ‘mitai is one of the few cases of an AP boundary aligning an inflectional boundary.

Another factor is that they tend to allow otherwise rare phonological operations,

namely, segmental alternations and deletions and accent shifts.

Additionally, the less inflection-ish boundaries feel less “contained” in one
paradigm. Wa and mo, both of which feel very word-ish, can follow nouns, verbs,
adjectives, adjective nouns, and others. They can finish almost any kind of item’s AP.
This is in contrast to more inflection-ish 〉 which, if appears in an AP, the AP begins
mostly with an adjective. (Some inflectional suffixes “change” the inflection group

of the stem.)

Based on these observations, it was decided that preferably 1. If a boundary allows
segmental alternations or deletions or accent shifts or paring, it is an inflectional
boundary; 2. Ifa boundary is inflectional, all boundaries that are more “internal” are
also inflectional; 3. If a boundary can follow forms of multiple inflectional
paradigms, it is a word boundary; 4. The stem of an inflectional paradigm must have

at least one inherently corresponding nF mora.

These criteria are by no means strict rules, but what it means by “internal” in

criterion 2 is worth some clarification.

・ The boundary at which a merge occurs first is more internal.
For the structure A BC, the boundary between A and B is more internal.

For the structure A BC, the boundary between A and BC is less internal.

・ Two boundaries are not compared in internality if a word boundary intervenes.

For the structure A BC, if the boundary between AB and C is a word boundary, the
boundaries between A and B and the right or left of ABC are not compared in

internality.

・ In an AP, the boundary closer to the left edge but not the left edge itself is more

internal.

5.1.1: this is likely wrong. We still need to account for the non-copular desu which seem to be
A4|, as in darega desuka? — watashi ga desu. Ver. 5.2.0: »oak-obeche)

Nevertheless, factors considered when deciding certain boundaries to be
inflectional or word-level do not bind future decisions. Yet they are likely to be

referenced when making decisions.

Spelling design and boundary notation

Inflectional boundaries are graphically marked with special symbols,
the middle dot (-) or the hyphen-minus (-), inserted into tokens with
an inflectional boundary at its left edge.

Inflectional boundaries are further classed into the noun boundaries
(77-77 and m-i), the temporal noun boundaries (tm-ti and tm-i), the
adjectival noun boundaries (km-iii, km-ti, and km-i), the verb
boundaries (d-vi, d-v, d-iv, d-tii, d-ti, and d-i), and the adjective
boundaries (k-ii and k-1).

The Roman numeral given to the name of a boundary assumes the
same kind of relationship found in the word boundaries but in the
opposite direction: an inflectional boundary with a greater number
can freely precede an inflectional boundary with a smaller number as
long as the prefixes are the same.

Inflectional boundaries do not have aliases for indicating zeros. We
will later see that a zero [0] tm-ii]m-i is reasonably supposed, but m-i
is not called by other names.

Semantic features

In this chapter, some suffixes are introduced with what can be
regarded as semantic features with binary values. If a form is
indicated as [+ formal], the form carries certain grammatical
formality. Likewise, [+ past] indicates what can be loosely called the
past tense. These features are used to characterize competing suffixes
within the same paradigm. The semantic substances that they should
express are yet to be defined. They are used as convenient organizing

devices. As the semantic component of the theory advances these
tentative features will hopefully be replaced or substantiated.

¢ [formal] or frm

¢ [habitual] or hab

¢ [past] or pst

。 [irrealis] or irr

« [negative] or neg

。 [literary] or lit

¢ [interrogative] or int
¢ [imperative | or imp
¢ [complement] or cmp
¢ [collective] or col

¢ [possessive] or pos

。 [ablative] or abl

In each context, only those features that are useful to organize the
paradigm will be shown.

ADJECTIVES

Initial observations

Two syntactic boundaries are classed as adjective boundaries: k-i and
k-ii. Forms that are |k-i or |k-ii are called adjectives.

Although a form’s real-world meaning does not determine the
boundary type, as a tendency, the meaning of an adjective relates to
states and feelings.

The lemma of an adjective contains the 7 suffix. This suffix makes a
predicate and the resulting predicate takes an argument (usually the
subject) and optional modifiers.

。 soto ga sugoku samui. “It is so cold outside.”
The past tense is made by adding the suffix katta.
。 soto ga sugoku samukatta. “It was so cold outside.”

Some adjective suffixes have phonetic desu, but this should not be
confused with the copular desu, which is C3\A4/P2.

。 soto ga sugoku samuidesu. “It is so cold outside.” (formal)

The adverbial form takes the ku suffix. Kute also appears. They
slightly differ semantically.

。 samukute soto ni derarenai. “It is cold and I cannot go out.”

・ michthaba ga semaku, Okina kuruma wa torenat. “The road is
narrow and a big car cannot pass through.”

In the “basic” usage the adjective functions as a predicate, but when
followed by the suffix sa, it functions as a noun.

。 tokyono natsu wa atsusa ga kibishit.

When it functions like a noun, it can receive a nominal modifier.
。 kibishii atsusa ni taerarenakatta.

The garu form functions as a verb.

。 kodomo ga amarini ttagaru kara kusuri o nomaseta.

The so form functions as an adjectival noun.

s oishisona aisukurimu.

median
Main clause

Some of the suffixes that can follow ki are the following:

int frm pst neg

‘Ou            kiNA4/R1 - - - =
(ndesu          kiNA4/P2 - +  -  -
()1desuka       ki\A4/P4 + + - =
(katta          kiNA4/R1 —- - +. -
()-kattadesu       ki\A4/P2 -   +  + +

(_)-kattadesuka                   ki\A4/P4 +        +        + =

These items can constitute a main clause predicate. The semantic
features [interrogative], [formal], and [past] represent the clause
types. For example, '(_)-1desu makes a predicate that is declarative,
formal, and nonpast.

In the list, items that are k-i\A4/R1 are generally given [-
interrogative|. Since a main clause predicate that these items make
can be turned interrogative just by adding a corresponding
predicative intonation (R%), it is reasonable to assume they are by
default |- interrogative] (or underspecified) and the value [+
interrogative] is given by the intonation.

The [+ negative] forms are constituted with the “bridging” ku k-i\A3:

int frm pst neg lit

‘ku                                             ki\A3           ー         ー         ー         ー         ー

(Ver. 6.1.1) The “bridging” ku k-i\A3 is -ku not・ku. Thank you @horudu for
pointing this out.

arima'senndesitaka            A4\P4          + + 4+ ++ = +

Those that are [+ formal, + negative] have two different phonetic
forms for each. The -masen series feels slightly more literary than the
-desu series, so the -masen series are marked as [+ literary] and the
-desu series | - literary].

Unlike these negators, the bridging ku k-i\A3 does not generate A4|
when merging. Hence, any |A4 forms that are semantically
“connected” to the main adjective that ku is attached to must merge
after the negator merges:

。 kyo wa atsuku mo naku, samuku mo nai, chodoti kion da.

That kyo wa does not merge with atsuku (mo) is shown by:

|* Kyo wa     atsuku mo Naku        Samuku mo       Nai       |

Similarly, that ... hito wa does not merge with sukunaku (wa) is

shown by:

|* ...hitowa sukunakuwa Nai                            |

Subordinate clause

The same k-i boundary can constitute a subordinate clause. The
suffixes that constitute a subordinate clause predicate include:

hab pst irr Hit

(_)-kereba        kiNA4/C1 -  _  エー ーー

(kute       kiNA4/A4 — + ーー =

‘ku                  kiNA4/A4 - + -— +
()-kattara           kiNA4/C1 -   +  上 一
(to             ki\A4/A4 + -  foo
'‘C)1,to            ki\A4/A4 + -  foo

What is described with the [past] feature may need some attention
here. Consider the following pairs of sentences.

¢ oishikattara nandemo ii tte wake ja nai. “It’s not like anything will
be okay {once it turns out to be/if it has turned out to be}
delicious.”

¢ oishikereba nandemo 77 tte wake ja nai. “It’s not like anything
delicious is okay.”

。 moshi watashino hoga umakereba, watashi ga rida ni natte 1?
“Can I be the leader if I do it better (than you)?”

。 moshi watashino hoga umakattara, watashi ga rida ni natte 11?
“Can I be the leader if it has been shown that I do it better (than
you)?”

In these examples, -kattara is used with the assumption that there is
some particular event or time that the fact in question is revealed,
based on which what is stated in the main clause then holds, and
-kereba is used to refer to some law present in the context without
implying a specific event or time.

membrane
Some may question the validity of the use of the feature [past] here. As I
stated earlier, the semantic features are used as organizing devices and the
exact semantic content corresponding to each value of each feature is not
given.

Regardless, it is interesting that the temporal relations between the -katta
clause and the main clause are relative past and present, respectively, since
the same relative tense phenomenon can be observed in relative clauses such
as:

¢ daigakuni nyugaku suru toki wa kuro shita.

¢ daigakuni nyugaku shita toki wa kuro shita.

When referring to a particular event expected before what is stated in
the main clause can happen, kereba sounds awkward:

。 tsurakattara itte. “let me know if you are uncomfortable.”

・ tsurakereba itte. “let me know if you ever happen to be
uncomfortable”

The former expects that the agent may be uncomfortable. The latter is
stated as if it is a conditional rule that the agent is asked to comply
with, without referring to any particular event where the condition
holds true.

For [- irrealis], a somewhat similar contrast between |- past] and [+ past]
seems to be available between kute and 7 kara:

。 sono atarashiui gemuki wa takakute zenzen urenakatta. “The new game
console didn’t sell at all because it had turned out to be expensive.”

。 sono atarashii gemuki wa takai kara zenzen urenakatta. “The new game
console didn’t sell at all because it was expensive.”

As is obvious, katta kara is available as the “past” counterpart of i kara, and it
is hardly synonymous with kute:

。 sono atarashii gemuki wa takakatta kara zenzen urenakatta. “The new
game console didn’t sell at all because it had been expensive.”

The feature [habitual] is used here to capture the difference between
ito and kereba. The value [+ habitual] assigned to ito but not to
kereba reflects the difference in generality of the law in question. Ito
is typically used to state a constant law:

¢ suiminjikan ga miikaito byoki ni naru. “Short sleeps make you
sick.”

。 kuraito michini mayoiyasuti. “A dark path is hard to follow.”
。 heya ga hiroito nanikato benri. “A spacious room is convenient.”

Kereba |- habitual] is often used to refer to a conditional rule
provisionally claimed by the speaker.

。 omoshirokereba shichoritsu wa toreru.
。 toshi o tottemo kimochi ga wakakereba nandemo dekiru.

¢ okane ga hoshikereba baito demo sureba ti daro.

memoir
[+ negative] subordinate predicates are constituted with the same ku

k-i\A3 used in the main clause, followed by:

hab pst irr lit neg
nakereba                   A4NC1         ー        _         to         4
nakute                       A4\A4         ー         $+ =         +
maku                          A4\A4         ー         + 。         +        +
nakattara                  A4\C1         ー         +キ 。 十  ー         4
‘naito                          A4\A4         to         tL         4

The bridging ku k-i\A3 has also a negative counterpart:

int frm pst neg lit

maku                          A4\./A3. =        ー        ー         + =

A4\./A3 instead of A4/A3 indicates that it is obligatorily leftward-merging
and when it merges it generates ./A3.

This ensures negation is recursively applicable.
。 kyo wa samuku nai.

。 kyo wa samuku naku nai.

。 kyo wa samuku naku naku nai.

。 kyo wa samuku naku naku naku ...

The “resultative” usage

The “resultative” suffix ku k-i\A4/A2 functions like:

。 kare yori umaku wa narenakatta.

A4/R1
/A4
A4/A2
/A3       A4/A2
./A1   A1\A3    ./ki     k-i\A4/A2 A3\A4   A4\R1
| kare  yori   uma   -ku   wa narenakatta 」

That narenakatta merges last (that it is kareyori/ umakuwa\/
narenakatta\ and not *kareyori/ umakuwa/ narenakatta\\) is shown

by:

| Kare yori               umaku wa             Narenakatta                          |

It has been called “resultative” because, typically, it appears in a
sentence in which the adjective describes a result of a change.

。 ‘samu-ku ‘natt-a. “became cold.”
¢ 00'k1-ku s1'ta. “made bigger.”
。・ o0'k1-ku ‘miét-a. “appeared big.”

Forms that can sit under the phrase of the resultative ku seem to be
limited. From my quick introspection, it seems that yori phrases are
one of the few types.

。 asa ga samuku natta.

|* Asa ga   samuku Natta

minimum
The R positions suggest:

| AR                   }
A4/R1
/A4 4A4/A2 AA4NR
| asa ga samuku natta              ;

Interestingly, replacing asa with body parts seemingly changes the
structure:

。 ashi ga samuku natta.

| Ashiga samuku Natta

| 4A4Ra
A4/A2

/A4  A4/A2 AA4NR1

ashi ga samuku natta                    J

These two usages and their differing structures can be captured by
listing two samu’s in the lexicon, one for holistic sensations and the
other for sensations of specific body parts. More on these will be
discussed later in this section. »nationalist

It appears therefore that some adjectives have an extra “spot” that
accommodates certain types of |A4. Hoshii is one of these:

¢ akemi wa furuto ga hoshiku wa naranakatta.

| Akemiwa Furitto ga hoshiku wa    Naranakatta

| AR
A4/R1
/A4
A4/A2

and, among others, 77Q7:

¢ onaka ga itaku naranai yoni, yoku kande tabeta.

| Onakaga itaku Naranai yoni Yoku Kande    tabeta |
r                                                                            ~

| onaka ga        itaku          naranai yoni                               J

The negative form of the resultative usage accompanies naku A4\./A2
as In:

。 kareno taido ga itsumohodo yasashiku naku omoeta.

When the semantic condition is such that naku natta would appear,
instead, nakunatta tends to be used:

¢ suki datta ramen ga rinyuarude oishiku nakunatta.

This is likely best analyzed as nakunar ./d-ii and ta d-i\A4/R1.

molecule
The ku aru form

Sometimes |- negative] items are used in place of the
aforementioned [+ negative] series.

This happens often when ku is followed by wa, mo, koso, etc.
。 saishinkishuhodo de wa nai ga, soredemo takaku wa aru.
¢ chisaku mo aru shi okiku mo aru.

It is usually awkward to use ku aru without inserting wa, mo, or such
in between, but it is grammatical:

s chisaku aru shi okiku mo aru.

In the main clause the following items are used:

imp int frm pst neg lit
‘aru                   AA\R1         ー        ー        ー        ー         上 一

ar1'masita        A4\P2         ー        ー         +        +        +L
ari masitaka A4\P4         ー         +        +        +        +L
‘are                   A4\P4          + 。 一        ー        ー        ー        ー

In a subordinate clause the following items are used:

hab pst irr lit neg

areba               A4\C1         ー        ー         + =         +

‘atte                  A4\A4         ー         + =        ー         +

‘ari                     A4\A4         ー
attara              A4\C1         ー
‘aruto               A4\A4         +

The “adjunct” ku is not an adjective suffix

It seems as if some adjectives could take ku k-iii\A4/A2, where k-iii is

a temporarily supposed boundary for discussion, as in:

« te o hageshiku furimawashita.

。 yasashiku hohoenda.

This ostensible suffix ku appears only on limited adjectives. (Which is

why a new label would be necessary. )

。 *te o ureshiku furimawashita.

。 *modokashiku hohoenda.

momentum
These forms can be further modified by an adverb:

。 te o sugoi hageshiku furimawashita.

Teo Sugoi    hageshiku Furimawashita.
* Teo sugoi    Hageshiku Furimawashita.
| A4/R
A4/R1
A4/A2
/A4  ./A4     A4/A2 A4/R1
| te O   sugoi    hageshiku furimawashita            」

Until version 4, this ostensible suffix was intentionally
undistinguished from another ku |A2 due to the identical syntactic
right boundaries. For version 5, the decision was made to recognize
them separately to reflect the semantic and distributional differences.

The rationale for not distinguishing the two forms is documented briefly in
『形容詞について 4.1 , originally prepared for version 3.0, which however

stayed local until December 2023, referenced only internally.

If we were to recognize ku k-iii|, however, the problem is that some
would-be |k-iii adjectives then would be incompatible with kil,
despite having a greater Roman numeral, as shown by:

。 ureshigaru
。 *hageshigaru

Switching the statuses (the present k-ii to k-iii and the supposed k-iii
to k-ii) will not solve the problem:

。 *ureshiku furimawashita.

。 hageshiku furimawashita.

The choice was then between setting up a neutral, non-k boundary
and regarding these adjunct forms as unit items. As of version 5, we
choose the latter, considering:

・ The adjectives are a closed class and notoriously scarce; the lexical
burden inflicted by treating the adjunct forms as unit items is,
although not necessarily very small, limited.

・ While preserving the spelling with no added cost would be the best
choice if attainable, simplifying the spelling at the said cost on the
lexicon is not the worst either and is reasonable.

Hence, the first two examples are now written as:
。 ‘te wo ha 'gesiku hurima ‘wastit-a.
¢ yasas1 ku hoho enmd・a.

The quantifier oku modifying the “existential” aru is a case of an
adjective-like adjunct:

。 kyonenno harowinde wa yotta wakamono ga jidoshato sesshoku
suru jiko ga oku arimashita.

Suffixes that “derive” forms of other paradigms

The suffix so k-i\km-i turns an adjective into an adjectival noun:
。 terashimakun ga tsukutta keki wa totemo mazuso datta.

。 sore na noni, takaso na osaifu o misebirakasarete, mukatsuite,
yatchatta.

kawaii does not take so. Kawaiso is “pitiable” not “seems to be cute.”
Accordingly, kawa in。 kawa'ikute, kawa ikatta, etc., are written as unit
items.

The negative counterpart of so is given by:

。 nasaso A4|km-i

which follows ku.

« zenzen tanoshiku nasaso.

。 konaida okutte kureta sanpuru waruku nasaso datta yo.

The suffix soni k-i\A4/A2 is necessary because the adjectival noun
making so is |k-i and the adjectival noun suffix 77 is k-ii].

¢ anmari oishisoni taberu kara kotchi made onaka ga suitekita.

The negative counterpart of soni is nasasoni A4|A2.

。 miyazakikun wa jugyochu wa itsumo tanoshiku nasasoni shite iru.
The suffix sa k-i\R2/m-ii turns an adjective into a noun.

。 munashisade karada ga ugokanaku natta.

。 yukino omosade yane ga tsubureteshimatta.

As oz does not take sa, oo kn, ‘ookiku, oo ' kikatta, ookisa’, etc., are
written as unit items.

When the host of sa is a derived adjective of a verb, such as tabeta,
the resulting phrase such as tabetasa makes an interesting (though it
may be colloquial) structure:

¢amaimono o tabetasa ga gaman dekinakute daietto ga
obotsukanai.

r                           ny                                                                                 ~
R2/m-il
A4/k-ii
./A4                 A4/k-ii        k-i\R2/m-ii          A1\A4
| amaimono o tabeta          Sa                            ga...                       ;

A premise of the labels in the tree above is that those derived ta forms
are A4|k-ii while the typical lexical adjectives are ./k-ii or ./k-i. Some
forms, those that are conventionally treated as “irregular,” are, since
in Kyouro they must be treated as tokens, lexically A4|k-ii. They

This is a colloquial term and some speakers/teachers may simply dismiss it as
a nonword.

It would be worth drawing a tree for the latter as it has the same kind
of interesting structure as the aforementioned case:

The suffix sugi k-i\d-i turns an adjective into a verb.

。 hoshiti hon ga atta kedo, takasugite kaenakatta.

。 naraken wa aruite ikuniwa tosugiru.

The suffix gar k-ii\d-v turns an adjective into a verb.

。 tsumano shi o itsumademo kanashigatte bakariwa trarenai.

(A Handbook of Japanese Grammar Patterns for Teacher’s and
Learner’s. )

。 kodomo ga omocha o hoshigatte jibetani suwarikonde naite ita.

(A Handbook of Japanese Grammar Patterns for Teacher’s and
Learner’s. )

Author’s note to self: the garu construction seems to be |d-v as opposed to |
d-vi, but unlike typical |d-v forms, this accepts an o-phrase.

As shown, the resulting verb accepts an o-phrase.

| A4/A4
A4/A4
/A4              /A4          A4/A4
| kodomo ga omochao hoshigatte ...                                   ;

This property of the gar suffix reveals an interesting nature of atsut.
As is commonly known, this adjective can refer to a specific object
that is hot or a spatial or atmospheric condition (room temperature,
climate, weather, etc) that is hot:

。 kohi ga atsukute nomenai.
¢ shinshitsu ga atsukute nemurenai.

These two usages may seem to be realizations of an ambiguous
meaning of the word, but that they are distinct syntactically is
revealed when gar is attached:

。 kohi o atsugatte nomanai.

¢ *shinshitsu o atsugatte nemuranai. Intended: “She wont sleep as
she complains about how she feels hot in the bedroom”

A phonetic equivalent of the latter is an acceptable sentence when the
sentence refers to the bedroom as an object as opposed to a
condition.

mopery
« #shinshitsu o atsugatte nemuranai. “She wont sleep as she
complains about how the bedroom is too hot (to touch/to go in/
etc).”

From these observations, it appears that atsui is actually at least two
homophonic adjectives:

¢ atsu ./k-ii “is hot (of an object)”

eatsu ./k-i “is hot (as a holistic sensation about the room
temperature, weather, etc)”

The latter is judged here as |k-i to reflect the fact that the garu form
behaves differently from the |k-ii adjectives. As a result, atsugar must
be admitted as a simple verb:

¢ atsugar ./d-v

The aforementioned two usages of samu can receive a similar
treatment. samu ./k-ii, samu ./k-i and samugar./d-v can be listed in
the lexicon.

A quick Twitter search (December 2023) revealed that some speakers have
samugar that takes a place, time, or garment as an object, as exemplified by:

。 shacho ga kondo wa sukato o samugatte iru.

https://x.com/mamama s/status/1558739075284103168?

s=61&t=P5zngLY-OSHK20gjuSYsug

I have not consulted with any of the users in the search result on their native
language, but if this usage of samugar should be incorporated into the
present description of the language, there must be a syntactic form that is
samugar ./d-i. Whether this is of an (almost) unit form such as samugar ./d-v
or a complex form such as samu ./k-1i followed by gar k-ii\d-v, I am currently
unable to identify the lexical item, either because of some unknown factors
that prevent me from accessing the knowledge or because I simply do not
have this item in my vocabulary. (December 2023)

VERBS

INITIAL OBSERVATIONS

A token whose right boundary is either di d-ii, d-iii, div dv or d-vi is a verb.

The lemma (the form that is tradittionally listed as the header of a dictionary entry)
of a verb contains the suffix ‘(_)r-u (ru in Hepburn). This form makes a predicate
and can take arguments and adjuncts.

kuizuni seikai suruto hagendattsu ga moraeru.

The past tense is constructed with the suffix ta (ta or da in Hepburn).

kuizuni seikai shite hagendattsu 0 moratta.
The adverbial form is formed with the suffix t-e, ‘(_)r-éba, and (_)rru to (te, reba and
ruto in Hpeburn) among others.

gyuunyuu wo mainiti nom・eba kennkou ni na rér-u.

senn sel ga watasl - no nigadé wo ‘kait-e konntesuto-de syo一- wo tott-a.
In the “basic” usage, verbs function as predicates. When followed by the suffix ikata,
however, they function like nouns.

tabekata ga kitanai.
When they function like a noun, they can be modified by nominal modifiers and
not by adverbial modifiers.

kareno tabekata ga amarini kitanakute watashiwa zekku shita.

The itai form functions as an adjective.

worumatoni ittara zettaini hottodoggu wo tabetai.

The iso form functions as an adjectival noun.

imanimo shiniso datta kara tsui tasukete shimatta.

The plain series can be the predicate of a relative clause while the formal series
cannot. This fact is accounted for by assuming |Ru for the plain series and |P2 for the

formal series.

taro ga hon 0 kakimashita.

taro ga {kaita/*kakimashita} hon wa omoshiroidesu.

(Both from lori 2012, p. 50.)
The plain series of the verb are considered |R1 reflecting the fact that they can be

followed by ka and kadoka ‘whether’ unlike the adjectival noun’s na form.

negotiator
kouhann ga 1z1、de kirru ka douka da kewo kann gaet-e ru nokamo.

“atarashii ie ga kireina kadoka wa satokonitotte juyo da.

The interrogative forms have partially regular correspondence with the declarative
forms. For the formal series, adding ka to the end of the declarative form gives the
corresponding interrogative form. For the plain form, in contrast, the interrogative
form has the same phonetic form as the declarative form, except the interrogative

form comes with R%.

The interrogative forms are here assumed to be |P4, which means quoting particles
such as tte can follow them without breaking a sentence. The rising intonation

(R%) stays on the predicate when followed by tte.

The imperatives such as tabero and nome are not considered as part of the paradigm. The
imperative forms we will discuss in this section are separate from those.

A typical intonation used with the plain imperative form is the rising intonation.
gasonn'd-e — play (with me)!
The imperative forms with and without the rising intonation are pragmatically
distinct and the native speaker chooses one over the other at each time.
asonn de — play (with me)! (assertive)
Other imperative suffixes include ina and inasai.

Until version 6.2, had Ci\A4 and mo Ci\A4 were assumed, but it has been recognized that this
assumption was problematic. Many items with Ci on the right, including kereba k-i\A4/Ci and
kattara k-i\A4/Ci, cannot be followed by these two items. As a fix, in version 6.3, I list t-eha
d-i\A4/A4 and temo d-i\A4/A4 here and and remove 2 C1\A4 and mo C1\Aq4 from the
boundary map in p. kangaroo.

Semantic features are used here mostly in the same way as in the adjectives section.

The following are examples of [+ past].

kaizyou ni ‘tuit-ara ‘mazu uketuke -de ne—mu tagu wo uketotte、kuda sai. —

§Planned-Name-Tag

If you happen to arrive at the site, first receive your name tag at the reception

desk.
§Happening-Name-Tag

The latter does not particularly expect that the agent is going to arrive at the site.

Rather, it is stated as a conditional rule that the agent is asked to comply.

The use of a [+ irrealis| suffix when referring to an event that is usually taken for
granted leads to unnaturalness.
‘aka ni “nar-éba tal wann-ni 1 kou.
§Happening-laiwan-Trip
The |Ci series need some attention here. In the following example, fukumete |Ci

‘including’ is followed by no Ci]:

niga tu mlzyuu、 kuniti wo hu kumét-e no hana sl wo ste ru nn desu yo. — I’m
talking about [it], including [the matter] on February 29th.

(検察側の罪人.Translation is mine)

§Okino-Leap-Day

In the following example, the verb shitara |Ci ‘if have done’ is followed by the

copula da C3\A4/P1, which we have seen in p. jeans.

keihinn’ ga moraeru no ha ‘kuizu-ni seikai, sitara da. — It is if [you]
correctly answer the quiz that you can receive the prize.

§ Quiz-Receive-Prize
It is important to recognize that the copula da generates A4|. As I briefly mentioned
in p. london, there seems to be a series of copula-like, non-copular d-words that are
used to make, semantically speaking, a sentence fragment that complements

another sentence, as exemplified by the following:

annna koto 1erru tte mmmgennsel oka "smndesu. yorim1 yot'te isya ga desu
3 yo. 一- There must be something wrong with [their] personality given that

[they] can say such a thing. [They are] a doctor of all others.

rekisi’ ga subete honntou da to ha omoe:nai nn desu >Yo、ne. watasi ha
desu ga. — I cant seem to think history is right about everything, though it is
just me [thinking this].

(From https://x.com/1000000ao0bara/status/1610167299184676864?s=61&t=P5zngLY-oSHK2O0gjuSYsug.

Assumed typos are corrected. Translation is mine.)

In both of these examples, desu seems to be placed on |A4. That is, it seems that it is
desu A4|. The right boundary seems to be similar to the copular desu C3\A4/P2. It is
probably A4|P2. Since the “fragment” supported by desu A4|P2 does not seem to

follow another |A4, here I judge it as desu A4\./P2 (»minimum).

The following example (acceptable to me) might appear as a counter example of the
hypothesis that the desu fragment cannot follow |A4.

・ a, kore wa akumademo “watashi wa” desu. hokano hitoni wa zenzen kankei nai. “Oh, this is
just 1. It is completely irrelevant to other people.”

(from https://x.com/c2shock/status/1764618193820406254?s=61&t=P5zngLY-oSHK2O0gjusYsug.

Translation is mine.)

I think the graphically quoted portion, “watashi wa,” is indeed syntactically quoted, and
accordingly the desu here is not the fragmentizer desu (A4\./P2).

We can test if a given desu or da is a true copula or a pseudo one by checking
whether the resulting phrase can follow |A4. In the aforementioned example “keihin
ga moraeru no wa kuizuni seikai shitara da, the part “kuizuni seikai shitara da”
follows |A4 “keihin ga moraeru no wa.” In the tree notation, this can be represented

as:

A4/P1

A4/R1                                                           A4/C1

kehnnn ga mora erru no ha ‘kuizu-ni senkan si'tara da

An experimental new notation is used here. An overline indicates merge. The syntactic lables
of the terminal nodes are not shown.

This observasion suggests that the da in this sentence is probably a true copula.

This ambiguity is reflected in semantics. Consider the following:

In some tweets of @kykrfmz, as of February 2025, these suffixes are written with a
space and without an accent. Version 6.3 makes it clear that the author thinks they

should be written in the way as noted here.

My bad habit of writing them with a space and without an accent ultimately stems from the
now deprecated version 1 rule of “contraction,” which states that where the form is seen to be
a contracted form of a fuller form, it is spelled simply by removing the absent letters from the
fuller form. The statement of the now obsolete rule can be viewed here as of April 2025:

OTHER SUFFIXES

Many of the suffixes listed in this subsection are assumed to have i at the beginning. These
are based on my introspection, and other native speakers of Tokyo Japanese may find 1
descriptively more accurate for some or all of the suffixes in question. The speller is
responsible for deciding what phonetic forms should be reflected in the spelling.

i: wuru d-ii\A4/Ri ‘it is possible that’

ie d-ii\d-i ‘it is possible that’

rta d-ii\A4/k-ii ‘want to’

The following example involves multiple groups of inflectional boundaries through gar
and tai.

・ samui. “Tm cold.’

・ samugaru. “I will act like ’'m cold.’

・ samugaritai. “I want to act like I’m cold.”

・ samugaritagaru. “I will act like I want to act like Tm cold.”

・ samugaritagaritai. “I want to act like I want to act like Tm cold.”

Generally, potential verbs are not followed by these items, and so are judged to

be |di

rrare d-iii\d-ii (honorific)

i- sugi d-iii\d-ii ‘excessively’

oO war d-v\d-iv ‘to finish’

i-'6é d-v\d-iv ‘to finish’

mare d-vi\d-v ‘to be done’

Rare, sase, etc., have the first accent on the right side of the middle dot so the spelling
form of sentences show the posessor of the accent clearly.

THE TRUE PASSIVE RARE AND THE ANNOYANCE RARE

To understand the difference between the boundaries d-vi and d-v, observe that
there are two homophonic “passive” suffixes.
ototoni purin o taberareta. “my brother ate my pudding”

§Brother-Ate-Pudding

ototoni nakareta. “annoyingly, my brother cried”
§Annoying-Brother-Cried

In the first example, the suffix rare refers to the fact that the speaker’s pudding
was eaten. The pudding receives the action of eating. In the second example, in
contrast, nothing receives the action of crying. If anything, the speaker expresses

her annoyance about her brother crying.

It is possible that in the first example the suffix rare is used to express

annoyance, in which case the pudding does not have to belong to the speaker. If

she has been annoyed about the fact that her brother was eating a pudding, the

suffix rare can be used.

At a glance these two readings of rare, received action and annoyance, may seem
to be contextual variations or ambiguity of the same syntactic form. However,
that they are not can be observed in the following pair of sentences:
ototoni purin o taberarehajimeta. “my brother started eating my pudding.”
§Brother-Started-Pudding

ototoni purin o tabehajimerareta. “annoyingly, my brother started eating a
pudding.”
§Annoying-Started-Pudding

In the first example, the suffix rare is used for a received action. In the second
example, annoyance. It is observed that the received action rare cannot follow
hajime, but the annoyance rare can. Hence, the annoyance rare must have a

“shallower” left boundary than the received action rare.
This and other observations are summarized as the following:

rare d-vild-v ‘to be done’ (passive)
rare diii|d-i ‘annoyingly’

hajime d-v|d-iv ‘to start doing’

ADJECTIVAL NOUNS

THE ONTOLOGY OF ADJECTIVAL NOUNS

What we call the adjectival nouns or their close equivalents have received various
treatments in grammatical theories and descriptions. This subsection lays out some
ontological bases of adjectival nouns (km-i, km-ii, k-iii) as opposed to adjectives
(k-i, k-ii) and nouns (m-i, m-ii).

See Masuoka and Takubo (1992), Takahashi et al. (2005), and Kubo (1994) for existing
treatments.

In p. 113, Kubo (1994) argues that adjectives and adjectival nouns (in her words, bound

adjectives and free adjectives) share the same nominal suffix sa. As shown below, they do not.

First, observe that not all items with |C2 can be followed by na mono ‘the thing

that.

kuruma deshita       * kurumana mono

*

sakura deshita              sakurana mono

kirei deshita                   kireina mono

taihen deshita              taihenna mono

Similarly, some |C2 items can be followed by sa ‘the degree of’ and so ‘seemingly’

while the others cannot.

* kurumasa    * kurumaso
* sakurasa     * sakuraso
kireisa        kireiso
taihensa       taihenso

These facts seem to justify the distinction between nouns and adjectival nouns.

Next, observe the difference between adjectives (k-i, k-ii) and adjectival nouns (km-
i, km-ii, km-iii). Only the former of the two can be followed by idesu and only the
latter can be followed by desu:

* kowa desu

*

kirei desu

sukuna desu

taihen desu

kowaidesu

* kireiidesu

sukunaidesu

* taihen’idesu

Both of these classes have a phonetic sa that turns them into a noun (m-ii), but they

are two separate items as becomes apparent in the phonological representations:

utuku's1
suku'na
haya
kuren

talhenn

So that follows adjectives

+ “Sa,
+ <Sa

+ “Sa,

+ “(C)sa,

+ ‘(_)-sa,

utuku'si-sa,
suku'na:sa,
haya:sa,

‘jure '1-sa,

taihe'nn -sa’

and the one that follows adjectival nouns appear to be

identical in their phonological forms:

utuku sr
suku na
‘kirel

talhenn

+ ・SOU,
+ ・SOU
+ -SOU
+ -SOU

—> utuku sr sou.
ー> sukumna・sou
—> kuren- sou

—> tanhenm - sou

For the sake of the simpler syntax, however, these so’s are separately admitted to

the lexicon.

so km-ii\km-i

so k-i\km-i

so being km-ii\km-i allows mitai as in kimimitaina (“of the likes of you”) and yo as in omotta

yona (“as I thought”) to be considered adjectival nouns (ki). See also the note in p.

photographer.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS

Adjectival nouns are phonologically noun-like and semantically adjective-like.

The phonetically bare form of them can be followed by an item with C2|, some of

which are copulas, to describe the state of the subject.
Some of the phonetically non-null adjectival noun suffixes are na, ni, so, and sa.

yuuguredoki - no namima-m uka bu ‘kirei-na ho ha, tyotto sutekr desu. —
It is so lovely in the evening a beautiful sail is floating on the waves.

(丘の家のミッキーェiTranslation is mine.)

§Eveninig-Sail-Waves

konn na nkagenn -na honn wo ‘das-u no wo miruto kono sakka mo ‘mou

osimai da ‘na. — Judging from the fact that he has published a book of such a

sloppy work, his career as an author is finished.
(小学館韓日日韓事典. Translation is mine.)
§Author-Career-Finished

The suffix so can be attached to an adjectival noun and in turn forms an adjectival

noun.

‘Rinndo syounenn ha Husigi-'sou’-na kao wo si'te Watasi-n1 Ga gannbo- no
koto wo Knta. — The boy Rindo asked me about gagambos with a curious

face.

§Rindo-Curious-Gagambos

But the form with so cannot be further followed by so. This necessitates setting up

multiple adjectival noun boundaries.

Some adjectival nouns take ni to describe an event but the others do not. (e.g.,
kyokutanni ‘extremely’ :: *yushuni intended: ‘excellently’). This too can be described

with multiple boundary types.

‘Yumi ha Toukyou-no Natu-no ‘atu:ssa wo Kyoku'tann-ni kirat't-e, Natu
Yasuml ha Karuizawa nl 1ki'ta’1 to ‘Titi-m1 Se gannd・a. — Yumi extremely
hated the summer heat and begged her father to take her to Karuizawa for the

summer vacation.

if the given ni form is a description of the inherent character of the event or an external
judgment on the event. Jgaini is a nice example of the latter (see the note in p. photographer).

The suffixes that follow |km-i include:                                                                                           a                               on
Kagakutekini is a less nice example of the latter. It would fail on the R tone test described in p.

[o] km-i\C2                                                                           photographer. For the purpose of spelling, it would be beneficial to think about the two
categories.

-na km-i\A4/R2

daiji cannot be followed by na and therefore it is not an adjectival noun. (Compare daijina’s      KM-II

tones with sukina, hetana, jozuna, etc. This fact as well as the decision that daijina is not part

of the adjectival noun paradigm was announced in this 2019 blogpost of mine.)                             km-ii can be followed by:

The former is necessary to explain the fact that adjectival nouns can be followed by          |               _          _

copulas.

Some examples:

Wealthy people in Thailand use Hua Hin as a summer resort.

§Rich-Thais-Huahin
yuuhuku ./k-ii

hitobito R2\m-ii (»sine. Probably hitobito R2/m-i coexists.)

Although hitobito here, unlike hito, does not show variations in pronunciation, it seems
reasonable to postulate two types of them. One obligatorily takes an modifier like it does in
this sentence, and the other does not necessarily do so. m-ii suffixes sounds bad when they
attach to hitobito without its modifier.

Do not confuse -na with the copular na C2\A4/Rz2b that connects to no, nn, noka,

and nnda.

Many adjectival nouns have teki at the end and many of them are |km-i. An exmaple of a |km-
i adjectival noun is kagakuteki. While kagakutekini (“scientiifically”) is natural, kagakutekisa,
kagakutekiso, and kagakutekisoni (respectively, the intended meanings are: “scientificness,”
“seems scientific,’ and “in such a way that it seems scientific”) are awkward. The distance
between na (a km-i suffix) and ni (a km-iii suffix) is part of the design. In this case,
kagakutekina is written as kagakuteki'-na and kagakutekini is written as kagakutekl nn.

itemo              d-i\A4

Some may question why soni independently of so is necessary. We will later see ni
km-iii\A4/A2. We have to distinguish this ni from the phonetic né part of soni since,

in order for ni km-ii| to connect to supposed so km-ii\km-i, it has to be km-il.

Compare:
yumeisoni           ^ yumeini
yubosoni            * yuboni
tekisetsusoni          tekisetsuni
seimitsusoni           seimitsuni

Do not confuse ni here with the copular ni C2\A4/A2:

yumei ni natta “became famous”

yubo ninatta “became promising”

tekisetsu ni natta “became appropriate”

seimitsu ni natta “became precise”

yumeina hito ni natta “became a famous person”

yubona hoho ni natta “became a promising measure”

tekisetsuna setsumei ni natta “became an appropriate explanation”

seimitsu na chizu ni natta “became a precise map”

To discern whether a phonetic ni is ni km-iii\A4/A2 or a sequence of [0] km-ii|C2 and ni C2|
Az, replacing the adjectival noun part with a noun phrase can be useful because a noun
phrase can be connected to C2]. For example, gijutsu ga んOo ni hattatsu shita ‘the technology

has been highly developed’ can be compared to gijusu ga kodona gijutsu ni hattatsu shita ‘the
technology has become a high technology. Here kodo and kodona gijutsu seem to be
interchangeable and therefore it seems that this ni is C2|A2. The suffix ni km-iii|A2 can be
used to describe the manner in which the event in question happens. The word kodo as in
kédo ni hattatsu shita refers to the high state of the resulting technology and not to the way in
which it has been developed.

Another class of items that can be confusing is those such as igaini ‘unexpectedly. This is a
unit item and the phonetic ni in it is neither a copula nor an adjectival noun suffix. One way
to tell igaini is not an adjectival noun is to observe if in the typical setting the modified
predicate receives the R tone, e.g., Dame dato omotta ga, Igaini Daijobu datta, where the R
tone is indicated by a capital letter. If igaini semantically modifies daijobu, as in “it was okay
in the way that it was unexpected,” it is unlikely that the predicate receives the R tone by
default. That is, if daijobu is modified by some adverbial phrase and still receives the R tone, it
is less likely that it is perceived as “neutral.” The correct interpretation of igaini daijobu datta
is “unexpectedly, it was okay = it was unexpected that it was okay.” Compare it with dame dato
omotta ga, Girigiri daijobu datta. “I thought it would be not okay, but it was fine by a narrow
margin” where girigiri “by a narrow margin” modifies the predicate daijobu datta “was okay.’

photographer
Lastly, it may be worth mentioning that so km-ii\km-i is not km-i| or |km-ii because

otherwise the grammar would allow the following unacceptable forms:

*taihensoso

KM-IlI

km-ii can be followed by:
-m km-iii\A4/A2 ‘ly’
as in:

kore ga saigono chansu na node, kakujitsuni seiko sasetekudasai. — This is your

last chance, so make sure you succeed.
§ Your-Last-Chance

where
kakujitsu ./km-iii
seiko ./G1
sasetekudasai G1|

Ni km-iii\A2 constitutes an “adverbial” phrase that semantically modifies the
predicate of the same clause. The boundary km-iii as opposed to km-ii is postulated
in order to describe the distribution of this suffix. Some |km-ii items can take this

suffix and others cannot. To see this, study the following list:

kappatsuni    * idaini
junsuini      * kichoni
kaitekini      * yuboni
genjuni      *  yuryokuni
seidaini      * kimyoni
tekisetsuni    * igaini
yugani

tekidoni

(For making the list I referred to Lianping 2009.)

kireini ‘completely is not an adjectival noun. This is contrasted with kirei
‘beautiful’ and kireini ‘beautifully’.
As a general tendency, those adjectival nouns that cannot take ni semantically
modify things specifically, as opposed to events, and those that can take ni

semantically modify both things and events.

Two subcategories of adjectival nouns can be postulated. One that modifies things
and the other that modifies events. Many of event modifying adjectival nouns are ./

km-iii lexically and many of thing modifying adjectival nouns are ./km-ii lexically.

NOUNS

Some typical behaviors of a noun stem

Typically, a noun stem (|m-ii, |m-i) can be modified from the left.
。 tairyono mikanjusu

。 kokusaitekina jizendantai

This is captured by assuming:

。 mikanjusu R2/m-ii

。 jizendantai R2/m-ii

As evidence that R2| belongs to the stem instead of some larger
structure, the R2| “slot” remains open even with suffixes present:

。 tairyono mikanjusude onaka o kowashita.
。 kokusaitekina jizendantaikara tegami ga todoita.

The suffix -ppo turns a noun into an adjective. When this suffix is
present, both A4| and R2| modifications can be available, but the
former must come before the latter.

。 ikanimo tokyono usagippol.

tairy6no mikanjusU

。 *tokyono itkanimo usagippol.

This behavior of a noun stem is contrasted with those of adjective,
verb, and adjectival noun stems. For these types of stems, typically,
whether A4 or R2 modifications are allowed depends on the suffix.

Adjectives:

※

odoroku hodo shiroi

odoroku hodono shirosa

odoroku hodono shiroi
* odoroku hodo shirosa

Adjectival nouns:

odoroku hodo kirei                *
* odoroku hodo kireisa

Verbs:

otherwise has special effects.

Nouns, noun-like forms, and copulas

This subsection pertains to a broader category than just nouns as
defined in terms of m-ii and m-i. For explanatory purposes, we take
nouns as examples.

Nouns typically have R2 on the left.
s sutekina kaban
s kino totta shashin

Despite this, a noun can merge with a copula to make a predicate that

is A4|.
s。 kore wa sutekina kaban desu
s kore wa kino totta shashin desu

The fact that a predicate “headed” by a copula is A4| is explained if
the copula is C3\A4/P2.

A copula can be phonetically null (the zero copula).
s。 kore wa sutekina kaban.
s kore wa kino totta shashin.

Unlike desu C3\A4/P2, the zero copula cannot be followed by items
that are P2\ or P3\ such as yo (not the feminine yo) and tte (type-I
quoter):

。 *kore wa sutekina kaban yo
s “kore wa kino totta shashin tte twareta

but it allows type-II and type-III quotations:

TEMPORAL NOUNS

The ontology of temporal nouns

As temporal nouns are superficially similar to nouns, this subsection
is dedicated to establishing the case for the temporal noun
boundaries tm-ii and tm-i separate from the noun boundaries.

The nouns and the temporal nouns are phonetically similar. Also,
they both can be |C2 or |A1 in the phonetically bare form. But their
typical meanings are substantially different. Typically, a noun refers
to things and events while a temporal noun refers to a point in time.

Some of the clear cases where they differ are the suffixes niwa, nimo,
and madeni. Niwa is used to refer to a point in time no later than
which an event is located. Nimo is used to give an early (or the
earliest) possible time for the event in question, as in “he can be here
as soon as Monday.” Both of them seem to be difficult to relate with
noun forms while maintaining semantic coherency. The last one,
madeni, which is used to give the latest possible time of an event, is
inconceivable with an AP beginning with a noun.

。 yuki wa yoruniwa yamu hazu da.
。 gojira wa kyonimo osaka ni totatsu suru to mirarete iru.

。 koji wa kurisumasumadeni kanryo suru.

Some phonetically identical suffixes differ in meaning between nouns
and temporal nouns.

De as a noun suffix signifies the means of an action while the same-
sounding temporal noun suffix refers to the point in time at which a
state completes.

。 hochode ninjin o kiroto shitara yubi o kitteshimatta.

。 natsuyasumi wa kyode owari.
De, as in the following examples, that signifies a cause of an event is treated as
a copula: de C2\A4/A4.
。 musume ga kaze de watashi wa shigoto o yasunda.
。 kanojono yokogao ga amarini kirei de, kokoro ga suikomareteshimatta.

。 karui kimochide hajimeta arubaito ga omotta yori taihen de, suguni
yameteshimatta.

¢ dosokai ga saibanto onaji hi de, sanka dekinakatta.

Kara as a noun suffix signifies a source of a thing or event, but as a
temporal noun suffix, it signifies the point in time at which an event
or state begins.

¢ aitsukara moratta nuigurumi o itsumademo dazini totteoite iru
rashii.

Notes on temporal nouns (tm-ii, tm-i)

A temporal noun is any syntactic form with tm-ii or tm-i on its right
edge.

Since some items that refer to a point in time such as kino and ashita
function like adverbs (|A4), it is easy to erroneously infer that this
“adverbial” behavior is a common property of temporal nouns. The
following examples show that it is not the case.

kinomadeni                                 kurisumasumadeni
kino tabeta kurowassan *        kurisumasu tabeta kurowassan

Although they may seem to function like both adverbs and temporal
nouns, they are better characterized as homophones across two
seperate categories, the adverb class (|A2, |A3, or |A4) and the
temporal noun class (|tm-ii or |tm-i).

It is easy to misapprehend the phonetic ni part found in some items
that refer to a point in time as a temporal noun suffix. But the
following examples show that it is not.

« *kinoni tabeta kurowassan
s。 kurisumasuni tabeta kurowassan

It is better to recognize that some of them are phonetically similar
adverbs, in this case kurisumasuni R2/A2. (They differ from typical
adverbs in that they are R2|.) Some other adverbs of this type are:

s aidan
s madenti

s atoni

。 getsuyobini

Time-referring adverbs that refer to a point in time relative to the speech time
tend not to have ni and those that refer to a point in time not relative to the
speech time tend to have 77.

sulyobini

nichiyobini

daisanshuni
daiisshtni
dainishuni
nisennijusannenni

nisennijuninenni

Asa, yoru, hiru, and toki seem to be exceptions. Another way to think about it
is that those that are numerals (the names of the days of the week are
essentially numerals considering how they work) have ni and others do not.
Still, tokini, kurisumasuni, and several others are exceptions. Either way, this
is not considered as a syntactic or phonological phenomenon. These items are
treated as unit forms.

The bare form of a temporal noun typically has R2 on its left.

Syntactic and phonological trees

Recall that the sentence kawati Okina toshokan ni nara itta has the

following syntactic structure:

¢ kawaii/ okina/ toshokan\\/ ni\/ nara\/ itta\

ン

い、

kawaii okina toshokan ni nara itta
kawaii Okina toshokan ni nara
kawaii Okina toshokan ni
kawaii okina toshokan
okina toshokan

kawaii okina  toshokan ni  nara   itta

ン

All sentences are subject to the triangle constraint, but the said
constraint does not need the syntactic tree’s all terminal nodes.
Certain simplification is necessary for a sentence to be applied to the
triangle constraint. In the structure simplified for the triangle
constraint, the terminal nodes are APs. In this case, the simplified

structure looks like the following:

¢ kawaii/ okina/ toshokanninara\\/ itta\

kawaii Okina toshokanninara itta
kawaii okina toshokanninara

okina toshokanninara

kawaii okina                      toshokanninara

\_

itta

ノ

We call this kind of simplified structure the phonological tree of a

sentence as opposed to the syntactic tree.

Let us take another example:

The basic procedure to obtain the phonological
tree (Trimming)

Let us suppose we have a sentence that is syntactically represented
as:

・A BA

where a letter or a sequence of letters represents a syntactic form and
slashes are used as operators of the reverse Polish notation.

If the forms A and B are both AP-initial, the phonological tree of this
sentence will be identical (conversion is not necessary):

・A BA

Structure-changing operations are necessary if one or more forms in
the syntactic tree are non-AP-initial. Let us now represent non-AP-
initial forms in lowercase letters:

・A DA

The structure a B\ has not been found as far as I am aware. If it ever appears,
how it is mapped onto phonology must be investigated separately.

This syntactic form will be converted to the phonological form:
« Ab

which stands for the phonological sequence corresponding to the
syntactic sequence A b. Since this is a single AP form, slashes are not
necessary.

Now, observe that when converting A b\ to Ab, as the form b joined
A, the slash was removed.

<A b\ 一> Ab

When A and b join together, if A has a slash—that is, if A is
immediately followed by a slash—unlike b’s slash, A’s slash must be
placed on the right side of the new sequence Ab. That is,

© A\ b\ 一> Ab\

This implies,

°C A\ b\ —> C Ab\
and if A has multiple slashes,

・C D _ AND —> C D Ab\\

ruth
If b has multiple slashes and joins A, exactly one slash of b will be       1. FUYU no\ SAMU     sa\\ nt TAERARE nai\\

removed.
2. FUYUno                    SAMUsa\              ni\ TAERAREnai\

<・C A Db\\ 一> C  Ab\
3. FUYUno     SAMUsani\      TAERAREnai\

We call this operation trimming as it involves cutting down unwanted
branches of a tree. Trimming converts a syntactic tree to a          The phonological tree has been obtained.

We ignored zeros for ease of exposition. Zeros are treated in the same way as

syntactic tree of this sentence looks like the following in the reverse
Polish notation.

« KAWAII OKINA TOSHOKAN\\ ni\ nara  ITTA\

As per our new convention, the AP initial forms are in capital letters
and the other forms are in lowercase letters.

Our task is to find convertible local structures. Working from left to
right, (a) check whether trimming is applicable and apply if it is, and
(b) after trimming a local structure, apply the same procedure until
all constituents of the sentence are AP-initial.

The first step is to convert TOSHOKAN\\ ni\ to TOSHOKANni\\.
- KAWAII OKINA TOSHOKANni\\          nara\         ITTA\
Next, since TOSHOKANni\\ nara\ can be converted:

- KAWAII OKINA TOSHOKANninara\\                    ITTA\

Now, as the constituents of the structure are all AP-initial, we say that
the phonological tree has been obtained.

Let us now see how fuyuno samusani taerarenai is trimmed down
into the phonological tree:

S-THEORY

Restating the triangle constraint in terms of the
abstract feature ‘$’

Consider the following statement:

・In the phonological tree of a sentence, a phrase has R at its
beginning iff its inner phrase has R.

The statement holds everywhere but terminal nodes.
Now, consider the following:

¢ In the phonological tree of a sentence, a phrase has R at its
beginning iff it contains $, where $ is a feature that can be given to
an AP.

The revised statement holds everywhere including terminal nodes.

Distribution of $

It is assumed here that $ is a feature at most one instance of which
can be given to an AP. An AP in a sentence either does or does not
have $ (“dollar”). Also, as implied by the triangle constraint and the
fact that a sentence must begin with R, it is assumed that at least one
AP of a sentence must have $.

Now consider the following sentence, where R is indicated by the
capital letter.

¢ Ame ga futta. “It rained.”

Since a sentence must have at least one $ and the only AP that has R
is Ame ga, a $ must be given to Ame ga, which can be represented by
inserting the symbol $ at the top of the corresponding AP:

¢ $Ame ga futta. “It rained.”
Compare this with the following, in which the second AP has R.
« Ame Futta? “Did it rain?”

To account for this distribution of R, two different patterns of $ can
be thought of. One is to place a $ on Futta only, and the other is to
place a $ on both Ame and Futta.

e Ame $Futta? “Did it rain?”
。 $Ame $Futta? “Did it rain?”

As we will see later, in some cases one of the two analyses may be
preferred over the other. From the phonetic evidence alone, however,
nothing can be said to rule out one in favor of the other.

scholarship
$ and information structure

In a question, $ tends to be given to the AP that semantically
corresponds to the information being asked for. In a yes-no question,
$ tends to be given to the predicate of the main clause. In a wh-
question, $ tends to be given to the wh-word.

¢ Iida o koroshita no wa $Dare? “Who is it that killed Iida?”

When a question starts with the word nande (‘why’), the sentence
typically has only one $, which is given to the initial AP. This type of
sentence yields a globally downward pitch contour.

¢« $Nande tida wa korosareta no? “Why was lida killed?”

Answering these questions would yield declarative sentences. In these
sentences, the AP that corresponds to the information that was
originally asked for tends to have $.

。 lida o koroshita no wa $Dare? “Who is it that killed lida?”

- Tida o koroshita no wa $Yamamoto da. “Yamamoto is the one
who killed lida.”

- $Ashikawa ga tida o koroshita n da. “It is Ashikawa who killed
lida.”

In the examples above, the question asks for who and the
corresponding sentences have $ at the AP where the who is provided.

When the question is a why question, the information that is asked
for can be more complex, but the correspondences are not difficult to
see.

¢ $Nande yamamoto wa tida o koroshita no? “Why did Yamamoto
kill Iida?

- Yamamoto wa lida ga $Kirai datta n da. “Because Yamamoto
hated lida.”

¢« $Nande ashikawa wa tida o koroshita no? “Why did Ashikawa kill
lida?”

- Ashikawa wa Iida ga $Suki datta n da. “Because Ashikawa liked
lida.”

When the why-word is in the middle of a question, typically, $ sticks
to the why-word. The why-word “carries” $. (Observe that the
positions of R are in accordance with the triangle constraint.)

¢ Yamamoto ga tida o koroshita no wa $Naze? “For what reason did
Yamamoto kill lida?”

¢« Yamamoto wa Iida o $Naze koroshita no? “Why did Yamamoto kill
lida?”

A statement does not always have to be an answer to an explicit
question. Yet, the positions of $ are easier to predict under the
assumption that the statement corresponds to a question. The
sentence tida ga korosareta (“lida was killed”) has a few possible
versions depending on what implicit question it corresponds to:

¢ $lida ga korosareta (when it corresponds to “who was killed?”)

¢ Iida ga $Korosareta (when it corresponds to “What happened to
lida?”)

A third version is imaginable. It corresponds to something like “Why
are you crying?” but the phonetic form is identical to the second
version, just as predicted by the triangle constraint.

¢« $lida ga $Korosareta (when it corresponds to “Why are you
crying?”)

semantician
When the first AP of a multiple-AP word has R, whether the remaining AP's
have R is not completely predictable from the positions of $. When the word
nintokutenno (Emperor Nintoku) receives R, it is given only to the first AP
nintoku while for the word tokyddizunisi (Tokyo Disney Sea) R is given to
each of the two AP’s. It seems that the different distribution patterns of R for
these words need to be characterized lexically. Some common expressions
that seem to come in both forms interchangeable (at least for some speakers),
such as arigatogozaimasu, may receive the same treatment: the different
forms are the results of different lexical properties, not of different
information structures.

The basic idea of $-theory and the triangle constraint is explained in this 2019
blogpost of mine.

TOPICS ON LEXICAL ITEMS

Items that require a modifier

Certain items, including hn to, ‘tok1 (noun-like), ‘tok1 (adverb-like),
Ku ni and some others, cannot merge rightward, but a phrase having
them as its right node can merge rightward. That is, they can only
merge leftward first and the resulting phrase can merge rightward.

¢ watas1' ga ‘kita 'toki ha dare'mo 1'nakatta. “When I arrived,
nobody was there.”

¢ *'toki ha dare'mo 1 nakatta.

It is reasonable to postulate the following:

。 ‘toki1 R2\tm-ii. (noun-like)

e ‘tok1 R2\A4. (adverb-like)

e ku nl R2\m-ii

Another interesting item hn to cannot follow ano, kono, or sono.
¢ *a'no h1'to ha ‘dare? “Who is that person?”

¢ *ko'no hi to ha ‘dare? “Who is this person?”

« *so'no hi'to ha ‘dare? “Who is that person?”

When this construction is otherwise expected, the unit forms a
‘nohito, ko 'nohito, and so 'nohito are used.

¢ a'nohito ha ‘dare? “Who is that person?”
¢ ko'nohito ha ‘dare? “Who is this person?”
。 so nohito ha ‘dare? “Who is that person?”

These facts can be properly described if we split R2 into two: R2’ and
R3, and assume ano, kono, and sono are ./R3, so that only items that
are R3| can follow them. Under this assumption, most items we now
consider R2| will be R3|, most items we now consider |R2 will be |
R2’, and hi to, which cannot follow ano, kono, and sono, will be R2’|.

The proposed split of R2 remain unofficial for now. We for the time
being pretend that hn to just happens to not follow ano, kono, or

sono in all cases. The R2 split will likely be reflected in a future
version.

sine
Dake and its/their curious phonetic forms

This is an updated version of this blog post of mine, originally written for
version 1.7.

The morpheme dake (‘only’) concisely demonstrates (for native
speakers of Japanese) that a naive parsing can fail to find a syntactic
boundary and the notion of morpheme has no place in syntax. The
following sentences could not be properly characterized if dake
(unitalicized) was assumed as a common component.

i. Chichioya ga dayin na dake de honnin wa nanno torie mo nat.
“His only takeaway is his father being a minister and he himself is
a good-for-nothing.”

ii. Yaru dake yatte mimasho. “Let’s do it as far as we can.”

ili. Kyo ga saishubi de aru dakeni, kiai ga haitte iru. “As today is the
last day, they are full of spirit.”

iv. Watashi dake itte mo shoganai. “If I come alone, I'll be no use.”
v. Watashi dakeni osiete kureta n desu. “They told this only to me.”

vi. Watashi dakega sankasha ja nai. “I am not the only one
participating.”

vii. Watashi dakeo suki de ite kureru. “(She) likes only me and will
stay that way.”

viii.Watashini dake oshiete kureta n desu. “They told this only to

22

me.

In i, vi, and vii, dake may seem like behaving noun-like. The
phonological shape as it is suggested by the same sentences, in
addition to iii and v, seems to be something like da'ke. If it is a noun

and the accent number is one, it should yield a boundary fall in ii, iv,
and viii. In reality, no boundary falls are found in ii or iv.

In viii, a boundary fall is found between watashini and dake, which
may seem to suggest that the boundary fall is part of the lexical form
of dake instead of a result of the A1 boundary. (It is not expected that
watashini has |A1. Cf. *watashini ga.) But ii and iii contradict this
hypothesis as no boundary falls are found in yaru dake or aru dake.

These “problems” are not real. They are pseudo-problems. No
evidence suggests that all of these instances of the phonetic dake are
of the same lexical item. The fact is that these phonetic dake’s behave
differently both in syntax and in phonology. If the same phonetic
form across multiple sentences behaves differently syntactically or
phonologically, they are different lexical items.

In i, dake is R2b|C2 and phonologically da ke. In ii, it is R2b|A4 and
phonologically da ke. In iii, it is part of dakeni which is R2b|A4 and
da'ken1. In iv, it is A1|A4 and da ke. (Cf. otoko dake ‘only men’.
Also notice that no boundary fall arises between dake and itte.) In v,
it is A1|IA4 and da kenn. In vi, A1|A4, da kega. In vii, A1|A4, da
‘kewo. And in viii, A2|A4, 、da ke.

Below is another set of sentences corresponding to each of the items
above.

1. Mojisu ga onajina dake de naiyo wa zenzen chigau. “They just
have the same number of letters and the contents are totally
different.”

ii. Okane o morattara moratta dake tsukatte shimau. “Whenever
you receive money, you'll spend as much as you've received.”

iii. Wakai dakeni kaifuku ga haya. “It’s your youth that brings you
such a swift recovery.” (Kenkyusha’s New Japanese-English
Dictionary 5th Edition)

iv. Pasokon dake attemo sofuto ga naito yakuni tatanai. “If all you
have is a computer, it’s useless without software.”

v. Tagettono nomimono dakeni suiminyaku o ireta. “I put sleeping
pills only to the target’s drink.”

vi. Subete no kadai o teishutu shita hito dakega sotsugyo dekiru.
“Only those who submitted all assignments can graduate.”

vii. Risatkuru dekiru gomi dakeo aoi fukuroni treta. “I put only
recyclable garbage into the blue bag.”

viii.Jugyo o kesseki shita hitoni dake hoshukadai o dashita. “I gave
make-up assignments only to those who were absent from class.”

Despite the fact that some of their grammatical behaviors are
dissimilar, the native speaker of Japanese tends to think they stem
from the same entity. The naive assumption may be reinforced by the
notion of morpheme, which is commonly explained as the smallest
linguistic unit that retains a pairwise relation of form and meaning.
However, the notion of morpheme has no place in grammar. Any
attempt to incorporate it into grammar will be deceptive at best.

SPELLIND
GUIDELINES
ABOUT KYOURO VERSIONS AND
OLDER MATERIALS

Version management

New versions of Kyouro are released by modifying existing
documents or releasing new documents. When modifications or new
documents become public, only the parts of the theory or the rules
that are revised in the new texts are considered updated. Old analyses
and rules remain valid unless they have been invalidated by newly
given statements.

To keep Kyouro documents organized and keep clear which
document supersedes which, all Kyouro documents are given dot-
separated three-digit version numbers.

The rightmost digit is incremented when minor modifications,
including fixing typos, have been made to the document. This digit is
only used for indicating the version of the document per se to avoid
confusion when referencing multiple versions of the same document.

The remaining two digits indicate the present Kyouro version as of
the release of the document. When multiple documents provide
specific rules or analyses on the same topic, only those of the greater
version number are effective. Provided that, when an old document
receives correction, if the corrected version still does not represent
the latest version of Kyouro, only the rightmost digit is incremented
lest contents once overwritten become effective again.

When incrementing a digit, all digits on the right are set back to zero.

When incrementing either of the left two digits, usually, only the
middle digit is incremented. The leftmost digit is incremented at
arbitrary times based on the significance of the change or for any
reason that I feel reasonable. The leftmost digit is used somewhat
symbolically. Since the first version (released in 2018) through
version 5, the leftmost digit has been incremented once per year. It is
treated as the “major version” indicator and Kyouro 5 or version 5
refers to a version of Kyouro whose version number’s leftmost digit is

5.

None of the official documents, including this one, are meant to be a
complete statement of how the spelling system works. Kyouro
materials are intended to be referenced in conjunction with the other
existing materials.

Obsolete materials

¢ Starting with version 5, all files with a version number lower than
2.0.0 are obsolete.

THE DOT ABOVE

The general rules of the dot above

¢ In Kyouro, the vowel letters, including i, are dotless by default: a, 1,
u, e, o. Where certain conditions are met, a vowel letter receives a
dot above: a, i, é, 0.

¢ The letter u never graphically receives a dot above. When the letter
u immediately following another vowel letter is under such
circumstance that a, 1, e, or O would receive a dot above, the letter
u is replaced with the sequence wu. We say “u is dotted,” “u
receives a dot” and so on to refer to the process where u
immediately after another vowel is replaced with wu.

¢ As of version 5, all rules given in earlier versions to add or remove
dots to or from a vowel letter are now deprecated.

The kanji rule

« A vowel letter immediately following another vowel letter receives a
dot above if it corresponds to the left edge of a kanji.

The katakana rule

¢« Where it is spelled in katakana, all vowel letters immediately
following another vowel letter are dotted: a, 1, wu, e。 6. This does
not include a vowel letter that follows a long vowel symbol.

The vowel verb rule

« A vowel letter that corresponds to the final vowel of a vowel verb,
either e or i, is dotted: é, 1.

Some may question whether the second vocoids of kaetta and haitta
are syllabic. Regardless, since these vowel letters correspond to
offglides in other contexts than before a long consonant, they are
consistently written dotless:

食べた               tabeta
FAO Te               slmeta
伸びた               nobita
落ちた               otita

人入った

ka ett'a

The syllabicity rule

« A vowel letter immediately after another vowel letter receives a dot
if it consistently (i.e., regardless of the phonological environment of
the lexical item it belongs to) corresponds to a syllable nucleus’s
first mora.

A vowel letter corresponding to an underlying offglide that gains
syllabicity only under certain phonological contexts of the lexical item
it belongs to is written as nonsyllabic.

« A vowel letter corresponding consistently to a syllable nuceus which
in limited environments immediately (even without a space) follows
a vowel letter receives a dot.

The inflectional suffix reba is written as '(_)r-éba because the letter
é represents a nucleus and immediately follows a vowel letter in such
verb forms as waraeba and omoeba.

笑えば         wara'eba
話せば                ha'nas.eba
着れば               kireba

3E | \             'sa mtr1
遠い             to O+
多い             'O'O1

In the examples above, the adjective suffix 7 is written dotless in toz
and oi, in both of which the said suffix is realized as a nucleus, as it is
theorized that its syllabicity is a product of the phonological context.
(Offglides gain syllabicity after a bimoraic rhyme. »disinfection)

The rule of velar verbs

・A vowel letter i derived from an underlying k or g in a verb stem is
written dotted iff it follows e.

ゆらめいた yurameita
はなやいだ hanayauda

羽ばたいた habatata

The rule of w

¢ The letter 7 at the beginning of a verb suffix is consistently dotted if
it gains syllabicity when following an underlying w.

行い              okona''i

行います     okonar'masu

Note: this rule may be better incorporated into the syllabicity rule
along with the rule for reba. The difference between 7 and reba is that
7 is deleted after a vowel-ending stem. For this reason it is arguable
that the latter is not necessary consistently syllabic.

The rule of h

。はis written as ha if it is pronounced as wa.
¢ “\ is written as he if it is pronounced as e.

THE BUUNDARVFALL〔, 3

The basic rules of the boundary fall symbols

。 In Kyouro, spaces are dedicated to marking the word-level syntactic
boundaries. Where an AP boundary is present without a word-level
syntactic boundary coinciding, a boundary fall symbol, or ., is
inserted.

5 —                                   oto ko ixtupi ki
日本国語大辞典 n‘honn koku'go da zitenn

te                        'genn,_syusyou’

¢ A phonetically effective boundary fall is marked with the upper
boundary fall symbol (.). Whether and where a space is placed in
conjunction with a boundary fall symbol depends on the syntactic
context.

咳してる                     se ki site ru
行くだろうけど       ku daroukedo

ダメこれじゃ

dame kore zya

In this section, spaces adjacent to a boundary fall symbol are shown in grey to
avoid potential confusion.

¢ If a would-be boundary fall is canceled, the AP boundary is marked
by the lower boundary fall symbol, regardless of whether and where
space is adjacently present. This happens when the form on the left

side of the AP boundary ends with an F mora.

本もらった             honn moratta
帰るだろうから ka 'eru daroukara

帰るから明日

ka'erru kara _ asi'ta

¢ If a would-be boundary fall is “converted” to the F tone of the
preceding mora (»harmonica), the AP boundary is marked by the
upper boundary fall symbol, regardless of whether a space is
adjacently present. This happens when the form on the left side of
the AP boundary ends with a bimoraic rhyme and the accent is

placed at position 1 of the AP.

The A1 boundary fall

¢ The A1 boundary fall arises at an AP boundary where the left AP is |
Aj, not counting zeros between A1 and A4.

¢ The Ai boundary fall is marked by a boundary fall symbol with a
space only on the right side.

登った                   yama nobotta
ata ma butuke ta

家買った                1e`katta

For this type of boundary fall to be phonetically effective, the left AP’s
accent number must be 1.

富士山登った               ‘huzisann_ nobot ta
肩ぶつけた              kata butuke ta
車買った                   kuruma katta

When the left AP |A1 is not a one-word AP, which happens when ka (ka C2|
Ai or Ka R1|A1) is involved, both an active and inactive boundary falls seem
to be accepted (my introspection into the following examples, December
2023):

。 nande yatta no ga jibun ka wakaranai no?
¢ nande jusho ga amerika ka wakatta no?
。 nande rainenno torendo ga endaka ka shirabeteru no?

In general, if multiple pronunciations are possible, any of the possible forms
that can be expressed in Kyouro can be chosen. For this specific case, if the
student needs to understand the precise rules of the boundary fall, the
following explanations may be worth considering:

« The A1 boundary fall can be phonetically effective only if the left AP is a
one-word AP.

・ When the left AP is of more than one word and the AP’s accent number is 1,
both the active and inactive A1 boundary falls can be accepted.

« The Ai boundary fall can be phonetically effective if the left AP’s accent
number is 1 regardless of the number of words the AP consists of.

unless better evidence for or against any of these options is available.
The G1 boundary fall

¢ The G1 boundary fall arises at an AP boundary where the left AP is |
G1, not counting zeros between G1 and G2.

¢ The G1 boundary fall is marked by a boundary fall symbol with a
space only on the right side.

日本を旅した                 niho nn wo ta bi sr ta
楽団を指揮した              gakudann! wo si ki srta
和解を意図した             wakal wo ito si'ta

Lexical boundary falls

・A boundary fall in a tokenized form is written as part of the token.
This includes previously excluded instances where a boundary fall
is found at the right edge of a token.

THE INVERTED QUESTION MARK
(4)

The usage of the inverted question mark

¢ The inverted question mark ¢ is used to indicate the R% intonation
given to a predicate.

・c is attached to the beginning of the corresponding word. The
absence of ¢ indicates the absence of R%.

¢ In version 4 and earlier, the R% intonation was indicated by the
regular question mark (?). As of version 5, the symbol ‘?’ is
dedicated to transcribing the question mark of the source text,
regardless of whether R% is present.

Limitations of the present analyses of boundaries

The boundary system we have laid out captures some aspects of the
syntax of the language, but it is by no means a complete description.
Several factors are left out of the analysis and the theory needs to be
modified to accommodate them.

One of the yet-to-be-described factors is polarity. It is well-known
that some items require a negator. Such items are called negative
polarity items (NPI). One of the NPIs is shika:

¢ shinigami wa ringo shika tabenai.

(Death Note, Season 1, Episode 10, at about 9 min 10 sec.)

as opposed to:

・ *shinigami wa ringo shika taberu.

A negator is required for each shika that appears in the sentence:
。 miyamotosan wa suiyobi shika shussha shinat.

。 *miyamotosan shika sutyobi shika shussha shinai.

。 miyamotosan shika suiyobi shika shussha shinaku nat.

Update in ver. 6.0: shika received some formal descriptions in Semantics of
Tokyo Japanese.

Other syntactic factors we have ignored include valence and case.
。 ashita wa dobutsuen ni iku.
¢ *ashita wa dobutsuen o iku.

。 keikaku o jikko shita.

。 *ketkaku O jikko o shita.

Our syntactic description fails in several other places. Some defects
have received treatment, but many are left unpatched. I expect that a
significant portion of those factors is better handled with semantics.

When a teacher or textbook writer puts a sentence in Kyouro, it is
advised that a minor defect should not interfere with a boundary
identification. Taberu cannot complete a clause that includes shika,
but taberu should still be regarded as A4|R1. The list of the
boundaries is given with general characterizations and examples, and
the most suitable label for a given syntactic boundary should be
chosen from them unless not recognizing the boundary appears to be
more appropriate. Analyses provided in this document and other
Kyouro documents are meant to serve as references.

Also, note that Kyouro’s spelling rules are designed to be tolerant of
minor analytic inconsistencies. Whether a certain boundary is A2 or
A3 does not change the spelling as both are marked by a space.

If a boundary seems to be not working at a specific place in a
sentence, ask if some semantic explanation could rescue it. If a simple
and consistent semantic explanation can be provided (e.g., “This verb
does not accept a patient,” “This is an NPI,” etc.), that is, if you can
“shift the blame” from syntax to semantics, consider regarding the
boundary identification as a pass. If the boundary system appears to
be inescapably broken, consider not recognizing some would-be
boundaries of the sentence as a potential workaround. (Ultimately,
Kyouro allows, on the speller’s responsibility, spelling a sentence—no
matter how complex it may be—as a unit item, although it is not
recommended as the first choice.)

Romanization table

¢ The following is a recommended romanization table.

Nonstandard uses of small kana such as ぎぃ has been removed from the

table. While spellling such sequences with y is not altogether prohibited, it is
worth noting that if such a sequence is pronounced with a phonetic long

vowel, x is used instead. (Refer forward to p. sympathy.)

¢ The table can be modified based on students’ needs. Minimally, the
spelling must produce the correct orthographic form on the input
system the student is expected to use. (When a specific spelling is
given in this section, it is based on the recommended table here.

ELLIPSIS) or consecutive periods (...)) are written as a single

period surrounded by spaces (“ . ”). If ellipses are followed by a
regular period, it will be SPACE-PERIOD-SPACE-PERIOD (“. .”).

The Japanese middle dot (・: do not confuse this with the regular

middle dot used in suffixes) used in foreign names is written as a
slash (/).

¢ If an AP boundary coincides with a slash, the lower or upper
boundary fall symbol can be on either side of the slash.

Small tsu (doubled letters, xtu, and k)

¢ If the small tsu in question corresponds to a katakana or hiragana:

¢ double the following letter where it produces a small tsu (ai
paddo, kamu 'tyakka, hnyokko ).

。 use xtu where necessary. (‘1xtunu, hagaxtunya)

¢ (The rule of K): If the small tsu in question is at the end of an
on’yomi,

¢ if the kanji’s corresponding on’yomi in isolation ends with ku and
the next letter is k, then use k

。 otherwise, use xtu.

The original version of the rule of K was inspired by the following tweet of

Proper names

When the title of a literary work, such as a film, a novel, or a manga,
is used as a noun to refer to the work in a sentence, it is treated as a
unit item. Referring to Boku Dakega Inai Machi, aka Erased, by Kei
Sanbe, “I read Erased.” can be translated as boku da kega 1naima
‘tl wo yommd・a.

When it is treated as an autonomous sentence, however, it can be
written as a sentence itself. Boku Dakega Inai Machi can be called in
Kyouro boku da kega ina 1 ma th. This includes when the title is
bounded by the Japanese quotation marks ( |; )—like how an

utterance can be incorporated into a sentence with quotation marks.
The aforementioned sentence can be written as ['boku da kega
ima 1 ma hl wo 'yonnd.a.

For proper names, phonological processes, including accent
switching, may be evaded. If this happens, the spelling form should
reflect the typed and phonetic forms:

。 “boku dakega inai machi’no syujinko.

s | boku da kega nna 1 ma tl- no syu'zinnkou.

Capital letters

¢ IP boundaries are indicated by capitalizing the first letter of each
IP. If necessary, IP boundaries can be left implicit, in which case no
capital letters are used. (Mixed notations are not allowed.) Most of
the sentences provided as examples in this document are given
without capital letters because the IP boundary positions depend on
the placement of $. When transcribing a sentence with a reference
audio and sufficient contexts, the full notation, where all relevant
symbols including capital letters are appropriately used, is
recommended as the default option.
