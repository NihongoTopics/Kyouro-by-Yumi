<p><strong>Thinking of Kyouro as a language theory</strong></p>

<p>Hi — it’s Yumi. I’ve been reading Kyouro as more than a spelling scheme. For me, it’s a theory of how form and meaning line up in Tokyo Japanese, with a prosodic backbone that you can actually externalize in writing. The spelling is not decoration; it’s how the theory makes testable predictions you can check on paper and with your ears.</p>

<h3>What “theory” means to me here</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Ontology:</strong> mora → syllable → accent phrase (AP) → intonation phrase (IP) → sentence.</li>
  <li><strong>Tones:</strong> R, Lv, F; R/Lv together are nF. APs start with nF and may end with F.</li>
  <li><strong>Accents and falls:</strong> upper accent (phonetically active), lower accent (goal, not active), boundary fall, and its lower counterpart. These are part of the tokenized spelling and tie directly to structure.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>The rule that organizes my intuition</h3>
<p>Inside an AP, for each accent, <em>the mora immediately after the accent and all moras on the left receive nF; the rest receive F</em>. The consequence is simple and powerful: <strong>only the rightmost accent</strong> in the AP is phonetically effective; earlier accents still “exist” structurally but don’t change the surface nF/F pattern. See “Proposing a New Romanization System of Japanese (book).pdf,” p. 42.</p>

<h3>Items that reshape nF (within the stated conditions)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>-kara:</strong> extends the nF sequence when the preceding item’s accent number is 0. (p. 42)</li>
  <li><strong>-no:</strong> extends the nF sequence when the preceding item’s accent number is 1 and that accent is not at the left edge. (p. 42)</li>
</ul>
<p>These are not vague tendencies; they’re stated conditions that constrain when nF actually spreads. That makes it easy to predict—and to be wrong in a way you can diagnose.</p>

<h3>Lexicon and interface</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Accent numbers:</strong> Items come with accent positions encoded from the right edge. Stems have restricted ranges (verb and adjective constraints are discussed in the PDFs), and some suffixes carry accents. Multiple accents can co-occur, but the rightmost one decides the surface pattern (given the p. 42 rule).</li>
  <li><strong>Boundaries:</strong> The PDFs describe boundary types and how structure generates them, including direction-of-merging specifications and trimming. I read these as the syntax/semantics side of the theory telling prosody where junctures plausibly live.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why the spelling matters (to me)</h3>
<p>Because the theory is externalized as a tokenized spelling, I can “see” the derivation: accents, lower-accents-as-goals, and falls show up in the string. That makes claims <em>falsifiable</em>. If a predicted nF/F sequence or a boundary fall doesn’t show up where the notation says it should, something about my structure or accent choice is wrong.</p>

<h3>How I test myself</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Map structure:</strong> Decide what belongs in one AP/IP. If I place an nF after an F without a boundary between them, that’s already a red flag.</li>
  <li><strong>Assign accents:</strong> Use the lexicon’s accent numbers, then apply the p. 42 rule leftward from the post‑accent mora.</li>
  <li><strong>Attach items:</strong> If I add -kara or -no, I check whether their conditions hold; if not, I don’t “expect” nF to extend.</li>
  <li><strong>Spell + listen:</strong> Mark upper/lower accents and any boundary fall in the tokenized form; ask if the surface pattern matches what I can actually hear or would accept.</li>
</ol>

<h3>What would change my mind</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Examples where a non‑rightmost accent in an AP is consistently phonetically effective despite the rule.</li>
  <li>Reliable counterexamples where -kara/-no extend nF outside their stated accent-number conditions.</li>
  <li>Stable cases where the tokenized boundary/fall predictions don’t line up with what speakers produce or accept.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the theory writes its predictions into the string, counterevidence is relatively easy to state.</p>

<h3>Version awareness</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>p. 42 wording:</strong> The rule is “on the left,” not “behind it.” That matters for how we describe nF assignment in teaching and in examples.</li>
  <li><strong>Other commits:</strong> The PDFs document syllable theory updates, boundary inventory clarifications, trimming, and binary predicative intonations (R%, nR%). I keep those in mind when reading older notes or earlier drafts.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Why I like it as a theory of language</h3>
<p>It’s explicit about what counts as structure, it constrains where prosody can land, and it forces me to write down what I claim. I don’t have to guess “hidden” contours: if I can’t spell it in the tokenized form under the rules, I probably don’t understand the analysis yet.</p>

<h3>Sources I keep open</h3>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../Proposing a new romanization system of Japanese (book).pdf">Proposing a New Romanization System of Japanese (book).pdf</a> — p. 42 is my anchor for the nF rule and -kara/-no.</li>
  <li><a href="../Semantics of Tokyo Japanese.pdf">Semantics of Tokyo Japanese.pdf</a> — for how meanings, structure, and prosody interact.</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s where I am today. I’ll keep verifying each step against the PDFs, and when something feels off, I’ll show exactly which rule or boundary I used so the mismatch is clear. — Yumi</p>
