<p>Hi! I’m Yumi. I’m a 23‑year‑old biology student in Wisconsin, and I speak English and Japanese. I’m building a friendly, verifiable guide to Kyouro — the romanization and its connected ideas — using only the two PDFs in this folder.</p>

<p>What this blog is for: short, periodic notes about what I’m writing, what I verified, and what’s coming next. I’ll keep everything traceable back to the PDFs so you can double‑check me easily.</p>

<h3>Ground rules I’m following</h3>
<ul class="checklist">
  <li>Only use material from <em>Proposing a New Romanization System of Japanese</em> and <em>Semantics of Tokyo Japanese</em> here.</li>
  <li>No outside assumptions about linguistics or Japanese — just what the PDFs say.</li>
  <li>Small, practical explanations first; references back to the relevant sections.</li>
  <li>Iterate gently; it’s okay to refine as the manuscripts update.</li>
  <li>Be kind and clear. This is for people who want to see how to type, read, and understand, step by step.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>What I’m drafting</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A concise “Notation at a Glance” page (symbols and what they mean in Kyouro).</li>
  <li>A quick‑start page mapping a few common forms to keystrokes and spelling, with pointers to the relevant sections in the PDFs.</li>
  <li>Focused pages that restate sections like accent and boundaries in approachable language, with citations to the PDFs.</li>
  </ul>

<p>If you spot anything that doesn’t match the PDFs, please let me know — I’ll fix it. Thanks for reading! — Yumi</p>
